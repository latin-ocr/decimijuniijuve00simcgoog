xxxiv ‘INTRODUCTIONZ

somewhat prosaic duties relieved at rare intervals bysomewhat ss

dull festivity. Yet Plautus succeeds in being thoroughly genial:
he laughs without a touch os Juvenal’s ferocity at the follies οἵ
the world: at bottom he regards enjoyment as synonymous

with profligacy‚ but though his standard of profligacy is hardly ξ
reasonable he regards profligacy with tolerance as a folly not as ²

a crime. Even in Juvenal the relish for innocent pleasures
was not wholly extinct 3 we can trace its remains in the casual
wish that the fountain of Egeria had been left in its primaeval

simplicity, in the invitation to Persius to come ,to an early ³

‹linner at twelve and hear Homer and Virgil—a form of dissi-
pation, in Juvenal’s judgment, too, exciting to be indulged in
often. Perhaps the clearest trace of all is the pretty and sympa-

thetic description of the slave-boy who does not like being j

taken away from his kids to wait at table. Still it may be
said that the honest man, who is the ideal of most satiristS,
is seldom so unattractive as he appears in Juvenal. His
austerity indeed is so impracticable as to betray him into
unreality. If in order to be virtuous it is necessary to be dull
with the dulness of three centuries ag0, it becomes necessary,
in order to make existence endurable, that excesses should ¹be
permitted‚ not to say encouraged, in the young. For instance,
in the Eighth Satire, where the tone is intended to be lofty‚
after the indictment against Lateranus is complete, an advocate
is introduced to plead in extenuation, that everybody does the
same ,when young ·; whereto Juvenal only ventures to reply,
that Lateranus is oldenough to know better. In the Eleventh
Satire, where the tone is intended to be genial, he says it is
‚quite *proper for young men ,to take their mistresses to the
circus in their finery, and talkloud, and bet high3 for himself
he prefers to sun himself in a corner 'where he can get rid of his
toga. His ideal was hardly one to inspire the sustained enthu-
siasm or the tranquil assurance which would have · guaranteed
the consistency of his moral tone. ’ Asit is *we find him at one

· moment lashing himself into ⁴a tempest of indignation that a

nobleman should actually put the drag on his own· carriage
