Campanian wines would come up

123] In the age of Cicero advo-
cates were trained by intercourse
with advocates who had already
risen and possessed great practical
knowledge. Accordingly Cicero
could afford to deride the Greek
speakers for their dependence sor
technicalities on prom ters- De Ora·
dore, ἐξ 198, 25 3. T e pleaders of
Juvenal's day had no training except
in rhetoric, and a rhetorician wh0,
‘like Quintilian, attempted to enforce
legal studies was practically helpless.

133] Pliny speaks of murrhina
being dug u'p (H. N. xxxiii. 2, 5 5 ;
xxxvi& 8, §21); and of imitations
in glass (H. N. xxxvi. 67, 5 198),
which would explain Propertius (IV.
