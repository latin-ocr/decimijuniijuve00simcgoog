SATIRA, XIII..

1137

Accusatori nollet dare. Plurima felix ·
Paullatim vitia atque errores exuit omneS,
Pri-rna docet rectum Sapientia: quippe minuti

Semper et infirmi est animi exiguique voluptas

Ultio. Continuo sic collige, quod vindicta

Nemo magis gaudet, quam femina. Cur tamen hos tu
Evasisse puteS‚ quos diri conscia facti

Mens habet attonitos et surdo verbere caedit

Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum?

195

Poena autern vehemens ac multo saevior illis,

Quas et· Caedicius gravis invenit aut MadamanthuS,
Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.
Spartano cuidam respondit Pythia vates:

Haud impunitum quondam fore, quod dubitaret

Depositum retinere et fraudem jure tueri
Jurando: quaerebat enim, quae numinis esset'

Juvenal does not mean that he was
in irons at the moment os his execu-
tion: from the Phaedo 60 d, we
know that he was not.

liast thinks, asked for it.

194 surdo] Incorporeal, and
therefore inaudible·

197 caedicius] According to the
Scholia-st, Juvenal wished to hold
up the cruelty of this courtier of
Nero to public reprobation‚ per-
haps we may trust him for Caedicius
having been a courtier, but the
scholiasts have invented so many
impossible references to Nero that it
is impossible to be sure about this.

199 spartana] Glaucus, son of
Epicydes, was requested by a Mile-

sian to preserve the half of his for-
tune. The sons of the Milesian
claimed the money. Glaucus con-
sulted the oracle of Delphi on the
results of perjury, and received this
answer: —-
Γλαῦκ’ Ἐπικυδείδη, τὸ μὲν αὐτίκα
κέρδιον οὕτω
ὅρκῳ νικῆσαι, καὶ χρήματα ληΐσ·
σασθαι.
ὄρνυ’· ἐπεὶ θάνατός γε καὶ εὔορκον
μένει ἄνδρα.
ἀλλ’ ’Όρκου πάϊς ἐστὶν ἀνώνυμος,
οὐδ’ ἔπι χεῖρες,
ουδὲ arrides· κραιπνὸς δὲ μετέρχεο
ται, εἰσόκε πᾶσαν
συμμάρψας ὀλέσει γενεήν, καὶ οἶκον
ἅπαντα.
ἀνδρὸς δ’ εὐόρκου γενεή μετόπισθ εν
ἀμείνων.
He repented, but was told it was
too late, and his family had expired
before the battle of Salamis. (Cf.
Her. vi. 86.)
200 dubitaret retinere] Just the
opposite sense of dubito to dubitet

optare, sup. 97.
