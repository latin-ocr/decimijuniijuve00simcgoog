different as possible about comfort,
or, to put it in another way, that it is
soolish to idealise rights or interests
and unworthy not to idealise duties.

At the same time this is only a
practical answer; to a speculative
‘observet the world is just as incura-

bly bad because it fails to produce a
saultless happiness, as human nature
because it fails to shew a faultless
virtue.

1 7 Fonteio consule] One Fonteius
was consul ΑΛ). 12, another ΑΔ). 59,
3 third Λα). 67. See Introduction.

18 proficit uzu] Most MSS. have
prqfict's, all usu ,· the Scholiast and
P. have prcfia‘t; usus is a possible
inference from the Scholiast. The
Stoics oddly distinguished ‘profi-
cientes' among the universal mass

22 jactare jugum] Does not
mean to try to get rid of the yoke‚
but to toss about under it. Tr. “to
kick against the pricks. '’

·‘ numerus vix δι” One of the two
must be a correction. As to the
number, the Scholiast thinks of the
Seven SageS.

we are all but at the end of the
magnus annus of ten ages, in a
period whose depravity cannot be
measured by any metal m the Greek
scale. One Paris MS. of the tenth
century has non alias, a very pretty
conjecture.. “We are living at
