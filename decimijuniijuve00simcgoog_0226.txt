172 D. J. JUVENALIS' SATIRA xv1.

Quamvis jam tremuluS‚ captat pater. Hunc labor aequus
Provehit, et pulcro reddit sua dona labori. ι,

Ipsius certe ducis hoc referre videtur,

Ut, qui sortis erit, sit felicissimus idem,

Ut laeti phaleris omnes et torquibus omnes. “ 60 .

should have had a satire on abuses
in the army· , the connexion being
that commanders do· not understand
their own interest. The apparent

change of subiect would not be so·
great as in Sat. xit, where the ·
subject up to 106 is edueation by “

example, from thenoe to the end,
avarice. Another parallel would b'e
the seventh Satire‚ which begins

with the advantagoe of imperial„

patmnage, and after v. 21 dilates
exclusively on public neglect.
