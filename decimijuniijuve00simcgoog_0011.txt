Paris was put to death by Domitian, A. D. 83, while no Junius
was consul till ΑΛ). 84. We have no right to reject the story
of the exile, supported as it is by Sidonius Apollinaris, who

refers to it (nt. 266) as the established belief of the fifth cen· ’

treat the e'mperor as the offended party, and that three state
expressly that it was only on their republication *that the lines
on Paris gave offence. Domitian was quite capable of resent'-
