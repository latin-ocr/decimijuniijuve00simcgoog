little in the intervals of writing. ΤΙιε same might perhaps
be said of AristophaneS, but there is a tone of hilarity and
animal spirits about the old Attic Comedy‚ which springs
from the contagion of a crowd and the merriment of a holiday,
while in Roman Satire, where this element of gaiety is missing,
the author is always in danger of lapsing into stiff morality, or
ἢ crabbed invective, and never succeeds for long in maintaining
himself in the genial position of Aristophanes, who, though
often coarse, and almost always narrow, has the great gift of
sitting loose to his own beliefs: He is never reduced, like
Juvenal, to such sorry deviceS, in order to raise a laugh, as
appeals under protest to a mythology which he and his audience Χ
disbelieve 3 for he possesses a sar more piquant resource in the
outrageous parodies which he executes on a mythology which ' ¹
he is sincerely resolved to defend. In a parabasis of Aristo· ι
phaneS‚ we feel the merriment of the citizen, as well as the
anxiety and ambition of the author 3 in a Satire of Juvenal, 3
disappointed ambition is· the only visible motive of a poet who
wishes us to laugh, because he is long past laughing.

It is to the credit of Juvenal that he should have preferred
to consider himselfas the successor 'of Luciliu8‚ rather than as
the latest imitator of the Old Attic comedy. 1t is character· ⁴
istic of Roman culture that Horace and Persius, rather than
plead guilty to the charge of having borrowed nothing from
Greece, should have chosen to represent themselves as con· 2
tinuators of Aristophanes· It is characteristic of Roman society l
that the satura of Ennius should have given way to the satura
of Lucilius, The former· seems really to have been analogous 4
to the old comedy5 we cannot doubt that in the hands of ’
Ennius it tended to become a reproduction of Greek models, ¹
nor can we doubt that Lucilius, though he was a literary
innovator, and introduced a kind of poem for which there
·was no Greek precedent, inspired himself as much as possible ἕ
from Greek sources. In this way it is possible to account at ἑ
once for the well-known judgment of Quinctilian, that, in Satire J
at any rate, Roman literature was independent, and for.·the
