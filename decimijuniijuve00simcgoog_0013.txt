·INTRODUCTIONs. iit

tial published his Fourth Book, comparatively early under
Domitian.

In ΧΠ. 80, there rs an allusion to the rnner basin of the
Portus Augusti, which was not completed, according to the
Scholia, till Trajan, though the general construction of the
harbour was due to Claudius3 and 'the Scholiast may have
confused the harbour at Centum Cellae, now Civita Vecchia‚

· with that at Portus.

Moreover‚ as the information about Trajan is introduced to
give an erroneous sense to rursum, we are scarcely bound to
believe that the interiora—tuti stagna sinus had been enclosed
as a separate basin when Juvenal wrote.

In vm. 51, there is an ambiguous passage, that would suit
the latter part of Trajan's reign, or the early part of Vespasian’s,
almost equally well or ill. The reference to the eagles, which
control the conquered Batavian, would be most in place im-
mediately after the revolt of Civilis. On the other hand,
Vespasian never sent an expedition to the Euphrates3 and it
would be an unpleasaut inaccuracy to couple the achieve·
ments of Cerealis and Corbulo: unless, indeed, Juvenal may
mean to refer to the danger of the eastern frontier, in the
troubles after Nero's death. On the whole, the earlier date
seems best 3 as to mention nothing further than the Euphrates
would have been a very poor eompliment to Trajan, if his
reign was intended.

In xm. 27, there is a yet more ambiguous appeal to the age
of a friend, who was sixty years old when Juvenal wrote, and
was born when Fonteius was consul. This excites our hopes
of being able to fix the date of at least one whole satire ς but
unfortunately one Fonteius was consul A. n. 12, another A. D.
59, yet another A. D. 67. Lipsius and Professor Ramsay prefer
the earliest date ; most other authorities adopt the second.

In xv. 27, we have to ·choose in t'h'e same way between
one Junius, who was consul A. D. 84 3 another, who was consul
A. n. r 193 and a Juncus whose other names· may have been
Sextus Julius, who was consul on the ides of October A. n.
