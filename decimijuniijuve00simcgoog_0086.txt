32 ’ D. JUNII JUVENALIS

SATIRA IV.

Ecca iterum CrispinuS‚ et est mihi saepe vocandus

Ad parteS, monstrum nulla virtute redemtum

A vitiis; aegrae solaque. libidine sortes

Deliciae, viduas tantum aspernatur adulter.

Quid refert igitur, quantis jumenta fatiget 5
PorticibuS, quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

Jugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

Nemo malus felix, minime corruptor et idem

3 aegrae aeneiae] So P. and
Schol. 3 deliciae is at once rake and
beau. Cf. Mart. vlu. xlviii. 5, 6:

‘⁴ Non quicunque capit saturatas

Most MSS. have‘ aeger, sortis' and
delicias' and even ‘viduae, ' all

virum non habuisset appellari ait

where he takes an' airing in his litter,
are all within the limits of his city

P 7] The construction is,

“Quot

foro) emeritst'

9 Incestus] Incestum could only
be committed with a person' with
whom it was morally as weil as
legally impossible to contract a.
virtuous marriage. According to
Roman notions there was the same
moral impossibility of a valid mar-
riage between any man and a Vestal
who had not served out her thirty
years, as between a brother and
sister.

ιο] Domitian had revived this
punishment in an arbitrary w‚ay so
Juvenal sayS, “to what a risk Cris-
pinus exposed his Vestal!'' in a se-

her death. The Scholiast reads‘ vi- ”
tiata3’ if so, a Vestal under sen-
tence seemed piquant to CrispinuS.
