vi PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

was right in more than one passage, especially on
questions os punctuation where in the first instance Ι
Ι had followed Mayor. Wherever the text was simply
a matter of manuscript authority, 1 have =been glad to
give Jahn’s without discussion3 where the various read-
ings affected the sense or had a character of their own,
it seemed better to choose for myself and to give my .
reasons: -there is always something irritating about an
edition which indicates a variety of reading without
giving a clue to the *editor’s principle of selection.
- Juvenal is a writer in whom every attentive reader
.may hope to discover something fresh, while every
reader whose vigilance has not been chastened into
‘ sagacity must expect sometimes to discover more than*
¹ is there; but in dealing with Juvenal it is safest to err
on the side of excess· In a highly literary age artificial·
connexions and effects occur more readily than natural ;
a writer can hardly employ an expression which does
not imply a train of half-forgotten thought. The
chronology of Juvenal’s life and writings suggested in
the Introduction, which has been materially expanded,
is of course very precarious; but it seems to rest upon
facts which have still to find their place in a really
adequate conception of his system of satirical· allusion.
Three satires have been altogether omitted as not
required in University Examinations, which proceed on
the creditable hypothesis that all candidates for a pass
or honours either possess or cultivate the temper to
which such reading is as painful as it ought to be.
