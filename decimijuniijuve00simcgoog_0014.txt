,κ 27, as is proved by an inscription found in Sardinia, published
by the Aschaeological Society of Rome, Vol. vr. p. 231³ it is a
grant of citizenship to those who had served 26 years in the
fleet of Ravenna and to their familieS, and is dated by the year
of Hadrian’s reign and by the consulship of Juncus and Severus.

The first date is objected το, because Paris was dead, and
because a Juvenal was resident in Rome, and intimate with
·Martial, when the latter published his Seventh Book (circa
A. D. 93). The first objection is answered above. In reply to
the second, it would be sufficient to say that there is no reason
forusupposing that the exile lasted longer than six months, the
usual period for which such commands were conferred; though
it is hardly necessary to identify the friend of Martial with the
Satirist. . .

It seems at first sight as if there could be little doubt about
the date of the Fourth Satire: we assume that it must have
been written after Domitian's death, while Crispinus was still
alive to insult respectable opinion. On reflection perhaps we
shall see reason to qualify both these assumptions. Itis really
as hard to apply the wonderfully spirited opening of the Satire
to a favourite who had fallen as to a favourite who was dead.
Taking the first twenty or thirty lines alone as they stand, we
should certainly suppose that they were the introduction to a
very audacious lampoon on a reigning sovereign and on a
favourite still in power. We really do not know enough to set
aside this prima sacieprobability 3 moreover the main incident
of the poem is of a kind which a satirist might certainly be
expected to seize while it was fresh instead of waiting for twelve
years till the scandal had got cold. There is no reason to put
the council of the Turbot later than 89 Α. 1)., which is the latest
point at which we can suppose that Cornelius FuscuS, the-prae-
torian prefect, was alive in Italy to attend it. There is much
that is tempting in the supposition that the first draft of the
Fourth Satire is Juvenal's revenge on his return stom his
Egyptian exile. Such a lampoon might have had a clandestine
circulation when Domitian had left sor the Dacian frondet,
