Jamque vetus Graecos servabat cista libellos,

Et divina Opici rodebant carmina mures,

Nil habuit Codrus: quis enim negat? et tamen illud
Perdidit infelix totum nihil: ultimus autem

house is only three storieS, trans„

“The smoke has got to you in the
third story; '² if more, “For your
information‚ the smoke has got past
him into the third story ;” any way,
‘ tu' lives in the garret.

203 Proqu3a mnor]‘ ιΤοο small
for Procula:’' ‘Minor igne rogi”
(xv. 140); “Privatis majora focis'’
(iv. 66). ’Procula was the proverbial
small woman, as Codrus 15 the pro-
verbial poor man. It is better not
to marry them: it is far-fetched to
make Juvenal say his bed was too
small to leave room for the smallest
wife beside him.

205 Chiron] A dog’s name. Pro·
bably the representative of the dog
in mosaic, which adorus the thresh-
old of more prosperous houses. In
the same way the poor pleader‚
when successful, puts up the palm-
branches on the landing, which a
more fortunate brother would put

up at tl81e front door. Cf. inf„ vii.
117,11

“Rumpe miser tensum jecur,
, ut tibi lasso
Figantur virides, scalarum glorta,
palmae.''

206] “ He had a box too, to
hold his books; but it was too
old to keep the mice of Italy from
gnawing the inspired poems of
Greece.''

209 Perdidit] Pers. not aor. as is
shewn by juvabit.

212 Asturici] At Rome a great
mansion always kept the name of
its founder: the present owner is
Persicus. Inf. 221, note.

215 marmora] For panels ancl
besses, perhaps for pavement.

216 nuda. et eandida signa]
Nude figures in white marble.
Euphranor and Polycletus worked
in bronze.
