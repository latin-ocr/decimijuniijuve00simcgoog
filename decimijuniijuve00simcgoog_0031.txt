this conviction had helped to reconcile those who were not
personally interested ιιι the success of Julius or Octavian to the
necessity of seeing the control of the world deputed to a single
governor. ⁴But though the centralised administration justified
their confidence by its superior efficimcy, though at the end of
the first century much had been accomplished both in the
interest of the government and os the governed, the task was
immense, and it may be doubted whether the government of
Diocletian had overtaken its immensity3 it is certain that the
governmcnt of Domitian had not. There were still multitudes
of questions which were decided. by the courts or by the senate
almost without interference from the prince, and within this
extensive though diminishing arena it was still possible sor
politicians to win an influence that was almost independent of
the favour of the emperor. It was possible for an individual to .
confer so many obligations that men shrank from voting against
his opinion in the senate and against his clients in the courtsz

selecting the objects of its favour: even Nero had not a court,
Domitian had hardly favouriteS‚ and a share οξ this patronage
was within the reach of any citizen who could make it worth
the emperor’s while to court him. Nor was this all: a Vibius
Crispus or a Marcellus Eprius (Tac. de Oratoribus, vm. 3) could
e'xtend the influence to which he owed the friendship of Caesar
by an ostentation of that friendship: men shrank from offend-
ing the intimate of the Palace, if they did not shrink from
disobliging a man who had obliged them, or their colleagues
whom he had obliged. All this together made up the position
which Tacitus and his contemporaries designate by the compre·
hensive term potentia. And potentia was not to be had for
