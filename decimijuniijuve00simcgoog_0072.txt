D. JU-NII 'JUVENALIS

Graeculus esuriens in coelum, jusseriS, ibit.
Ad summam, non Maurus erat neque Sarmata nec Thrax,

Qui sumsit pennas mediis sed natus Athenis,

Horum ego non fugiam conchylia? me prior ille
Signabit Ρ fultusque toro meliore recumbet
Advectus Romam, quo pruna et cottana vento Ρ
Usque adeo nihil est, quod nostra infantia eoelum

asks him to witness his will, signabit,
before the old client, and gives him
a better lace at his table.

84, 85ῗ“ “Is it so mere a nothing
that my childhood breathed the air
of Aveyntine’' (which is the proper
nlace for an honest Plebeian to be

born), “and ,was reared’' (not on the
choice fruits of the East, bnt) “ on
the good old Sabine olive?”

88, 89] They are ingenious, as
well as bold. The patron is not a
strong man, he has a long throat‚
he tries to carry his head well up.
This reminds them of Hercules’
bull neck—when it was stretched
upwards and backwardS.
