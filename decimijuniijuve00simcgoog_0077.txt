166, 167 magno servorum ven·
mu] Slaves are expensive to buy
and expensive to keep.
⁵ 168negav1t] SotheMSS. “When
a man is transported, he is sure to
deny,'' the aorist is unnecessary;
but it is not worth while to alter it

' · ,ιο negabit. The paraphrase of the

Scholiast supports another conjec-
ture, negabis ; and it is more like
Latin that the nominative to a verb
shall be an unexpressed and indefi-
nite ‘ you‚' than an unexpressed and
indefinite ‘he.’

170 cucullo] Cf. “Tempora San·
tonico veles adoperta cucullo '' (inf.
viii. 145). The ‘capote' does not
seem to have been a purely Italian
gannent‚'as its dye in this passage
suggests a foreign origin, as does
also the epithet in the quotation
above. The variant culullo is con·
demned by ‘ que' and all the MSS.

171 si verum admittimus] “If
we can bear to realise the truth.’'

Cf. i. 21: “ Si vacat et placidi ratio·
nem admittitis, edam.'’

172 togam] Martial (1. 1. 31)
boasts that in Spain he never meets

a senator, and never has to put on ‚
a toga: ‘⁶ Lunata nusquam pellis ‘et ”

nusquam toga)

nisi mortuus] WWS dignity
can give him no tro .

173 ⁸1 quando] Because the per·
formances occur at rare inter-vals.—
Tandem, because they are eagerly
expected. Both are points of con-
trast with the constant shows of
Rome. So ‘in gremio matris,’ she
has no one with whom to leave her
baby 3 but she will not stay at home,
when the whole population is at the
theatre.

177—179] ‘¹ Everybody dresses
alike there. There is no difference
between the people at large and
the Senate in the orchestra. The
aediles think something is due to
their dignity‚ so they wear white;
but even they do not go beyond the
tunic.

180] Cf. vii. 129—145.
