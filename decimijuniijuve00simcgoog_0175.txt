Sed vitio caeci· propter patrimonia vivunt]

Catullus’ pretty things, but] the
greater part of the stores and tack-

ference between “this had no effect
either '' and “even this had no
effect.” -

a weak sear of a false quantity give

of the suspicion expressed in the

from his strait, lit. his straitened
sels. One MS. reads hac re, ‘ by
this expedient he clears the strait,’
which is a curious use of angustum}
and it seems hard to do without se,-
hac se might be a genuine reading,
altered in opposite directions.

62-4] One looks in vain for a
finite verb between tempora and pe-
laga. As it would be a violence to the
run of Latin to make prospera and
valentius predicates instead of epi-
thets, we have to choose between
supposing that Juvenal intended to
supply at least one verb to which

satum and tempora could be nomi·

natives, and supplying two ourselves
to suit our taste from the c'ontext.
