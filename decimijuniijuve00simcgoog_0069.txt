but the auctioneer did not supply
the slaveS. Moreover this view is
against the symmetry of the con·
struction, which is preserved if we
suppose that praebere corresponds to
conducere as effect to cause, while it
is violated by putting praebere in a
row with the many accusatives which
conducere governs. The hasta, proba-
bly a symbolos the comitia centuriata,

accusative after ‘libet,' as an un-
usual construction, suggested the
alternative conjectures vulgi and
jubet,· while ‘ quum' for ‘quem'
is due to pure stupidity and lazi·
ness. If vulgi is read, it will mean,
“ When the mob turn up their
thumbS, have the most expensive
gladiators killed for popularity.''
The Editor gave effect to the wishes
