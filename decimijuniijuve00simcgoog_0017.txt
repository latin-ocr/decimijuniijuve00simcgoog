darent? Here the sentence about Trajan’s philosopher, 'who
denounced and· condemned the noble -Barea, is an obvious
confusion due to the fact that, while Barea suffered under
Nero, the annotator supposed for the moment that Juvenal
was satirizing the reign of Trajan. Again‚ when we are told
that Messalina was the wife of Nero, it is more than doubtful
whether we are· to give the deponent credit for remembering
that Nero was one of the sumames of Claudius; nor is it
certain that the statement that Massa and Carus fell under the
accusation of Heliodorus is more than an inference from the
· description in the text of their trembling homage to the great
unknown of Juvenal.

When we turn to Valla’s excerpts from Probus, we find at
once a confirmation of our belief that most of the statements
quoted above represent the tradition of a period when many
authorities now lost were accessible‚ and an explanation of the
blunder about Trajan’s philosopher, which Valla himself re·

the err'or, (corrected in the above citation‚ on the authority of
Lipsius) which substituted Licinium Syllanum for L. Junium
Silanum, must be at least as old as his time. ·He adds that
Massa, the fool, and CaruS, the dwarf, both belonged to
Trajan, while he implies quite correctly that Messalina was
the wife of ClaudiuS, though he does not ask himself how the
same favourite could be an object of terror to members of
Trajan’s household, and to a victim of Claudius, or even Nero,
who certainly may have taken a fancy to aven ge his stepfather's
dishonour.

It is probable that Probus was perplexed by what is cer-
tainly difficult to explain,—the mention of a favourite of Nero,
and a corrupt governor· under Trajan, in the same satire.
Probus dilutes the difficulty by multiplying allusions to Trnjan,
as well as to Nero, without inquiring whether Trajan was a
contemporary of Tigellinus. The mod ernS, at any rate, since
Madvig, have generally cut the knot by supposing that the-
mention of Marius-definitely fixes the date of the whole satir&
