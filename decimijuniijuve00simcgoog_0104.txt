ςο. D. JUNH· JUVENALIS

-· · ,Quadringenta tibi si quis Deus aut similis Dis
Et melior fatis donaret homuncio: quantus
Ex nihilo fieres quantus Virronis amicus!

‘⁴ Da Trebio! pone ad Trebium'z Vis, frater, ab ipsis

135.

Ilibus ?” O nummi, vobis hunc praestat* honorem,

Vos estis fratreS.

Dominus tamen et domini rex

Si vis tu fieri, nuIlus tibi parvulus aula
Luserit 'Aeneas nec filia dulcior illo:

Jucundum et carum sterilis facit uxor amicum.

140.

Sed tua nunc Migale pariat licet, et pueros tres
In gremium patris fundat simul: ipse loquaci

. Gaudebit nid03 viridem thoraca jubebit

Afferri, minimasque nuces assemque rogatum,

’ Ad mensam quoties parasitus venerit infans,

145

'Vilibus ancipites fungi ponentur amiciS‚

Boletus domin03 sed quales Claudius edit

Ante illum uxoriS, post quem nil amplius edit.
Virro sibi et reliquis Virronibus illa jubebit

Poma dari, quorum solo pascaris odore:

Qualia perpetuus Phaeacum autumnus habebat,

132 Quadringenta] If the man siderab1e; and was well treated du-

had only a knight’s fortune, the pa·
tron would look forward to a legacy
and trffit him civilly3 if the man
were without children, he would do
a groet deal to be* his heir. ο -
t ¹34 Ex nihilo] After being no·
thin .

,ἶ 1385 imin] So P. and most MSS.
-ΑῙ, istis, ‘⁶ There, won’t you have
a cut of the loin?’' which is less
ungentlemanly than ipsiu but Virro,
and, Ι sear, Juvenal, were capable
of the vulgarity.

137 Dominus—enon] 1f youwish to
have dependants of your own, and
count your old master among them.

138, 139] “Vergilium ridet,'' says
the Scholiast. Did he mean that
Vergil, being unmarried, could and
did -leave his patrous-something con·

ring his life in consequence? if so,
was he wrong?

Cf. Verg. Aen. iv. 328. illo:
‘domina' .

141—145] As it is, he‘ likes you
to have children3 it is a cheap way
of patronizing you (cf. minimas
nacae, assem rogatum), and multi·
plies his flatterers (cf. parasitus
infans, assem rogatum).

143] vir-mem thoraca] Armi-
lausiam prasinam ut simiae. Schol.
Probably ·‘ a green spencer ;'’ as
Augustus always wore a woollen
thorax in winter.

ο 147 sed quales c. edit] ’⁸‘ Ay, and
hke those Claudius ate ''‹5¹{³h{⁷sff2,} 1-1
is Ieiiciiugllioffleasmrue} and that is
all the feast you are to get.” - - ·
