104] Ventribus, the conjecture
of H. ValeriuS, is most like Juvenal;
but all the MSS. have viribus, or
urbibus.

106, 7] It is worth noticing that
this tribute to stoicism is not ba-
lanced by an approach to a sneer
in {³23 Ῑὲαῐξιῦἰὴξξῗ εῗῐίτξεά read of

111] The implied assertions that
Gaul is eloquent, and that there are
pleaders in Britain, is more im-
portant than the express assertion
that Britain is taught by Gaul.

113] “Still the people is a
noble one; and the precedent of
Saguntus may excuse such a deed ;”
or ‘⁸ and Saguntus has a deed of the

same kind which it has to excuse on
the same grounds,” or, “Saguntus
has some such plea” (necessity) ‘⁴ to
urge.” The Romans generously for·
got that there had been a strong
cariihalginian party in Saguntum up
to t e ast.

114 fide] The fidelity of Sagun-
tus to the Roman alliance is com·
pared with the fidelity of Calagurris
to the remains of Sertorius, which
were in the town. It seems that,
aster all, Calagurris must have capi-
tulated, as the clades of Saguntus
was sim ly the ordinary fate of
towns ta en by storm, unless Juve-
nal means that it was a peculiar
