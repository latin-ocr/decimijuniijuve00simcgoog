began their rhetorical education with
politioel suasoriae, and went on to
legal contmvetm'ae.

20 Auruncae] Suessa Aurunoe„
where Lucilius was born.

23] Praetising as a ‘ bestiaria‚’
in the costume of an Amazon. This
profession, and that of gladiator,
was opened to women under Nero,
and closed to them by Severus.

25] Repeated (x. 226).

26 canopi] Canopus was to
Alexandria what Greenwich and
Rotherhithe are to London, a town
of sailors and their parasites‚ some·
times visited by pleasure-seekers
from the capital, cf. xv. 46 n.

27 maninus] A favourite of Do-

mitian, flattered by Martial‚ cs. iv. ’

24. According to the Scholiast he
was raised to the senate by Nero, it
would be natural however to take
the next line as an allusion to his
equestrian rank, cf. vii. 89, Semen-

stri vatum digitos circumligat auro·

28] His fingers sweat under his
light summer ring of plain gold.
At the same time it probably refers
to a personal peculiarity: the least
thing made him perspire bemuse he
took no exercise‚ cf. iv. 108 n.

29 madoris gemmae] A gem of
any size.

32 causitum—Mathonis] Matho is
a bankrupt (vii. 129); abraggart (xi.
34); and a standing butt of Martial.
causidicus is a mere hack pleader in
Cicero, who wrote when advocates
were still patrous, not mere servants
of their clients. Tr. When coun-
cillor Matho comes by in his new
litter, and his worship fills it. As

· it was not usual for two people to

ride in a litter, ipso must be a sneer
at Matho's d'1gnity and cannot be
taken as emphasising plena which is
a sneer at his size.
