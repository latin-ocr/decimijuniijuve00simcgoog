'xlviii INTRODUCTION.

bably the commentator on Virgil). It may be well to exhibit 1
some specimens of this “licentum'’ taken chiefly, though not
exclusively, from the old corrector of Pithou’s MS„ who
wished to bring his copy into respectable conformity to the
common type. In this endeavour he sometimes effaced the
original reading entirely, sometimes he left it legible besides ξ
his own correction, so that it might perhaps be possible to Ι
ascertain, if the MS. were now accessible, whether it was cor- ³
rected by two different handS, or whether the difference in
the style of the corrections is due to the fact that the same
·owner went through the MS. twice, possibly with different
authorities

In 111. 13, P. had pres[e]ntius from a reminiscence of ι
·Virgil, who is fond of praesens in this sense, Ec. 1. 42, Georg. y
·1. 10, 11. 126, while the corrector and the other MSS. have f

-to make room for ic, perhaps because P.’s original had sor-
gotten the lu'c at v. 16, and wished to substitute “ hisJ’ At
v. 29, P. and the Scholia give Artorius, most other MSS. read
Arturius, and several have Arturi to match at v. 212, which s
certainly looks like patching 3 on the other hand, P. and the
Scholia have municipales at v. 34, which the corrector and the
interpolated MSS. give correctly. Two lines further on, the
corrector deliberately gives the difficult reading vuhgus quem
lubet (unless he intended to write vulg-t), while P. had the easy
reading vulgus quum jubet, and other MSS. endeavour to meet Δ
the difficulty by reading vulgi. Again at v. 218, the corrector
alters the easy reading Haec Asianorum, which is found in κ
Ρ. and the Scholia, into the difficult ficasianorum, which the
other MSS. give with trifling variations, so that it seems that
here at least P.’s archetype deliberately altered the text to

remove a difficulty. v
In x1. 38, P. had most probably culina, like two other ⁴

MSS„ while the corrector and the majority of MSS. read 4
crumina orcrumena. At XI. 91, P. has postremo, the maj0rity ’
