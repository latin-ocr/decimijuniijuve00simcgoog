INTRODUCTION. xliii

2· densed and fastidiens author like Persius, in a writer so
i vigorous and yet so prolix as Juvenal, it is possible to defend
ξ. most of them as at worst pardonable redundancieS, it would
z be easy to defend all of them as belonging to alternative
drafts of the passages in which they occur, between which
3 the writer never decided.
‚ ’Most of them make perfectly good sense where they stand,
· and are supported by all the ancient authorities. Others are
κ omitted by several MSS„ and one or two interrupt the con-
nexion wherever they can be placed. The first fact proves at
most that they displeased ancient critics as well as modern ;
. the second would be decisive if there were not reason to
believe that Juvenal never finished the revision of his satireS.
The introductory satire is naturally polished with most care,
and there only one critic has been found to suspect one line
(v. 157), which is so difficult that his suspicion is likely to be
more popular than it deserves.
In the Third Satire Jahn condemns v. 104 ¹, against the
MSS. and John of Salisbury3 Heinrich and Pinzger condemn
v. 11 3 as an unnecessary explanation, for the same reason, if
the MSS. were few or worthleSS, vv. 49, 50, might be elimi-
· nated3 Heinecke condemns v. 281.
In the Fourth Satire nobody condemns any thing.
- In the Fifth, Heinrich rejects the end of v. 9, and the
beginning of v. 10, and the whole of v. 66. Pinzger had
J> anticipated his dislike of v. 51 3 but the latter critic defends
ἶ V· 91, though omitted by Pithou’s MS. and condemned by
> Weber, Heinrich, Jahn,—who also condemns v. 140, I suppose
. for reasons of taste which would justisy Heinecke’s rejection of-
γ, vv. 146—148,
Ι In the Seventh, Jahn, Pinzger, and Heinrich condemn
... V· 15, which contains an unusual quantity 3 Jahn alters v. 50
Γ to suit his rejection of v. 51 3 Heinrich condemns vv. 138 and
ι 181 3 Valla condemned vv. 240, 241.

² Whenever nothing is said to the contrary, the MSS. are unanimous in
favour of the verse attacked.
