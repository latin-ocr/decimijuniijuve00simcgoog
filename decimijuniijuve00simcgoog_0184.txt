D. J UNn JUVENALIS

Hoc monstrum puero aut miranti sub aratro
Piscibus inventis et fetae comparo mulae, -

Sollicitus, tanquam lapides effuderit imber,
Examenque apium longa consederit uva
Culmine delubri, tanquam in mare fluxerit amnis

Gurgitibus ¹miris et lactis vortice torrens·

Intercepta decem quereris sestertia fraude

Sacrilega ?

Quid si bis centum perdidit alter
Hoc arcana modo ? maiorem tertius illa

Summam, quam patulae vix ceperat angulus arcae Ρ

Tam facile et pronum est superos contemnere testes,

Si mortalis idem nemo sciat! Aspice, quanta
Voce neget, quae sit ficti constantia vultus,
Per solis radios Tarpeiaque fulmina jurat,

Et Martis frameam et Cirrhaei spicula vatis,

Per calamos venatricis pharetramque puellae

Perque tuum, pater Aegaei Neptune, tridentem:
Addit et Herculeos arcus hastamque Minervae,

65 miranti sub mtto] Some
MSS. and editors, finding the as·
tonishment of a plough too strong,
read mirandis or-· miranter, others
get rid of the hiatus by altering aut
into vel or by interpolating jam
aster miranti, which has the ad-
vantage of throwing miranti into
the dative.

68 longa uva] βοτρυδόν, just as
we speak of a cluster of bees.

70 Gurgitibus mins] Depends
rather on fluxerit and is parallel to
lactis vorttce tort· ens.

71]‘ ‘Apostropham facit ad illum
cujus ob reditum sacrificavit‚' '.Schol
The writer confounds Catullus with
Corvinus, to whom the description
of Catullus' shipwreck' rs addressed.
the mistake is worth noticing as it
indicates that there were people to
whom Calv and Corv were indis-

tinguishable.

74] The chest rs large, and filled
in every comer.

76 mamm-mis idem nemo edat]
Grangaeus says it was common for
a man to talk of crimes he should
like to commit, si je ne craignais
autre que Dieu-

77 neget] Like sit depends upon
aspice; we are not to compare such
phrases as κτύπον δέδορκα. Juvenal
tells the reader to look at the man
and learn how loud his voice is and.
how steady his face. —Ficti‘ ‘though
ei ned.”

78 Per solis radios δια] By the
ra ys of the sun [w hich beheld him]‚·
byy the thunder of Jove [which may
crush him]-
