D. JUN11 JUVENALIS

’ Ad subitas Thoecum volucres nubemque sonoram
Pygmaeus parvis currit bellator in armis:
Mox impar hosti raptusque per aera curvis

Unguibus a saeva fertur grue. Sj videas hoc

Gentibus in nostriS, risu quatiare: sed illic,

Quanquam eadem assidue spectentur proelia, ridet

Nemo, ubi tota cohors pede non est altior uno.

Poena erit ? '' Abrepturn crede hunc graviore catena

ProtinuS, et nostro (quid plus velit ira ?) necari
Arbitrio: manet' illa tamen jactura, nec unquam
Depositum tibi sospes erit: sed corpore trunco

“At vindicta bonum vita jucundius ipsa.”

Nempe hoc indocti, quorum praecordia nullis
Interdum aut levibus videas flagrantia causis,
Quantulacunque adeo est occasio, sufficit irae:
Chrysippus non dicet idem nec mite Thaletis

Ingenium dulcique senex vicinus HymettO,

second; the order which is natural
for the poet of the pygmies, is the
reverse of that which is natural for
them.

better opportunity than ours.’'

is sport to us is death to them.

on the sufficiency of a little common
sense to subdue excessive irritation
at a trifling losS, Juvenal here falls
back on an appeal to philosophy ;
the subject is not congenial, and
after a dozen lines on the folly of
desiring vengeance, we have more
than fifty on the certainty that in
some form or other Calvinus will
have his revenge.
