it is the occasion of digging a ditch.
If not, we must read deducis, which
may mean either (β) “You will be
burnt, and are wasting your labour
on a grand scale ;” cf. vii. 48, 49,
“ Tenuique in pulvere sulcos Duci-

and even now are being drawn
through the sand to execution,”

roads are probably selected because
Paris was buried on one, Domitian
on the other. We cannot infer from
this p'assage that Juvenal had never
attacked contemporaries: the first
Satire in its present form was mani-
festly intended as an introduction to

a series of satires collected after the .

individuals satirised were dead and
gone.
