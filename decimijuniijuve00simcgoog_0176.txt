D. JUNH JUVENALIS

‘Ventus adest: inopi miserabilis arte cucurrit
Vestibus extentis et, quod superaverat unum,
Velo prora suo. Jam deficientibus AustriS‚

Spes vitae cum sole redit: tum gratus Iulo,

Atque novercali sedes praelata Lavin0‚
Conspicitur sublimis apex, cui candida nomen
Scrofa dedit, laetis Phrygibus mirabile sumen,
Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis

Tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora moles

Tyrrhenamque Pharon porrectaque brachia rursum,
Quae pelago occurrunt medio longeque relinquunt
Italiam. N on sic igitur mirabere portuS,

Quos natura dedit: sed trunca puppe magister

Interiora petit, Baianae pervia cymbae,

80

Tuti stagna sinus, gaudent ubi vertice raso

Garrula securi narrare pericula nautae.

Ite igitur, pueri, linguis animisque faventeS,

Sertaque delubris et farra imponite cultri5‚

Ac molles ornate focos glebamque virentem! 85
Jam sequar et, sacro quod praestat rite peract0,

69 volo prora. suo] The jib, or'

of Alba had been long destroyed,
Iulus could be represented as settling
on the Mons Albanus; of course the
top only was visible, and the site
of the town out of sight.

74 nunquam vltis] The satit-ist
had not to decide between ‘⁶ which
nobody had ever seen, ’' and ‘⁴ which
nobody ever saw ;’' his translators
are restricted to the first and worst.

76 rursum] Mayor, “stretched
out and bending back ;'' perhaps it is
sufficiently emphatic to be separated
from porrectaque brachia, and car·
ried back to intrat.—T henam
Pharon, the marvels of t are
reproduced in Italy.

79 Quot natura· dedit] Does this
mean that they are sur 3 that
at Alexandria the isle of Pharos was
ready to hand?

80 manne] Such as ply about
Baiae. While you are admiring the
grand port, the master makes for the
snug inner basin.

81 verdon ruo] They offered
their hair in accordance with a vow.

83 ling-un sumum] Because
if a slave sulked, that would be as
unlucky as ill-omened language.

84 delum] Little chapels serv·
ing sor all the country side. Theyheld
the images, in front of which any·
body inclined to sacrifice made one or
more turs altarS, sup. 2 ces-pes, inf. 85
molles focos, 94 altar-121. “
