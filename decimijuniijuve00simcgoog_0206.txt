¹52 D. JUNII· JUVENALIS

Sic possem affari: “ Dic, o vanissime, quis te

Festinare jubet? meliorem praesto magistro

Discipulum. Securus abi: vinceris, ut Ajax

Praeteriit Telamonem, ut Pelea vicit Achilles·

Parcendum est teneris: nondum implevere medullas 2 ¹5
Maturae mala nequitiae. Ast quum pectere barbam
Coeperit, et longi mucronem admittere cultri,

Falsus erit testis, vendet perjuria summa

Exigua, et Cereris tangens aramque pedemque.

Elatam jam crede nurum, si limina vestra ⁵ 22b
Mortifera cum dote subit. Quibus illa premetur

Per somnum digitis! nam quae terraque marique
Aequirenda putas, brevior via conferet illi.

Nullus enim magni· sceleris labor.” “ Haec ego nunquam
Mandavi‚” dices olim, “ nec talia suasi.” · 22 5
Mentis causa malae tamen est et origo penes te.

Nam quisquis magni census praecepit amorem

Et laevo monitu pueros producit avaros ’

[Et qui per fraudes patrimonia conduplicare]

Dat libertatem, et totas effundit habenas 230

215] Your son does not equal
you yet. Never mind, he has not
yet attained the full vices of ma·
turit .

21} Ast—Coeperit] Most MSS.
omit ast ; the particle is quite su·
periimus, the pleonasm is charac-
teristic of old Latin. Juvenal is
almost the last writer who can have
used it if he used it spontaneously.
He tells 'the father he will not have
to wait long, the boy will be a finish-
ed rogue as soon as he fancies the
down on his chin wants combing‚ as
soon as he begins to shave. This last
was a solemn ceremony, iii. 186 n.;
until his friends decided to perform
it, a boy had to assert his conscious-
ness of his beard by combing it.

217 mi] His face is too small

now for there to be roem to apply
the whole edge of a long rasor:
admittere, however, rather means
that there is use for the rasor on his
cheeks than space.

2¹9 vereris} It is difficult to
say whether Ceres comes in as the
patroness of the ' Eleusinian mys-
ter-ies, or as lqzsera, because law and
order begin with agriculture.

220 vestra] Of your family.

221 Horffllera] Though by the
Roman common law the dowry in
such a mse would go back to her
family, yet in fact it was a matter of
course for the husband to enrich
himself by every wife he buried: cf.
“Nerio jam tertia conditur uxor.'’
Pers. ii. 14.
