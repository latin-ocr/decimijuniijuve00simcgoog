time to make a will, and remember
his friends, but he has not done so3
so they come to scoff at his funeral,

subitae] An old man who over·

straight into a· hot bath, would very
likely bring on apoplexy.

an instance of παραὶ προσδοκίανε after

might think it awkward after liberet.
Instead, we have simplicitas, which
serves to identify the quality, which
the writer does not venture to desig»
