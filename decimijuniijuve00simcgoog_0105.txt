Credere quae possis surrepta sororibus Afris :-
Tu scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit,
Qui tegitur parma et galea, metuensque flagelli

Discit ab hirsuta jaculum torquere capella
Forsitan impensae Virronem parcere credas.

Hoc agit, ut doleas: nam quae comoedia, mim'us
Quis melior plorante gula Ρ Ergo omnia fiunt,

CogariS, pressoque diu stridere molari.

Tu tibi liber homo et regis conviva videris:
Captum te nidore suae putat ille culinae:
Nec male conjectat. Quis enim tam nudus, ut illum

Bis33ferat, Etruscum puero si contigit aurum,
Vel nodus tantum et signum de paupere loro Ρ

less primitive times a serious poet
infers perpetual spring from per-
petual flowerS, a satirist unending
autumn from unsailing fruit.
153—155] There are two theories
of these lines both as old as the Scho-
liast. According to one the apple
is munched by a monkey dress-
ed in uniform and whipped into
going through caval drill on the
back of a she-goat: i so the agger
will be the mound of Servius TulliuS,
a well-known hunge, and a good
place to shew a persor-ming monkey.
According to the other, we have a
barbarian recruit (liable to the flagel-
lum, not merely the vitis) learning
· cavalry drill (parma not scuto ;
Horace had a parma as a mounted
officer3 the cavalry was generally
recruited from hals-dependent tribes
on the frontier) from a shaggy old
she-goat os a driu-master. The ob·

jection to the first, which is the most
amusing, is that there is no autho-
rity for ab equo, or ab capella, in the
sense of ἀφ ἵππου. The objection
to the second is that capella sor a
dirty old woman cannot be proved
to be older than Ammianus Mar-
cellinus.
