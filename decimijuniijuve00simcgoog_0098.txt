44 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Qualis coena tamen ? Vinum, quod succida nolit

Lana pati :

Jurgia proludunt: sed mox et pocula torques

the cups is 38—483 and there we
see theps guests drink from glass not
earthenware‚ perhaps the subject of
the fight is ’that Trebius thinks the
freedmen don't ‘drink fair! Cf.

imitation of Hor. Od. 111. xiv. ιδ,
as the wine would be no better for
being a hundred years older. Ac-
cording to Pliny (H. Ν. xiv. 16),
the Op imian wine, dg'ffissum Β. C.
120, was absolutely undrinkable,
though valued sor mixing.
