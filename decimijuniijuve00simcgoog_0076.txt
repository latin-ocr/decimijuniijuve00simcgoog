154 81 pudor est de se] So the
Scholiast, and probably Pithou’s
MS., the corrector whereof and
the other MSS. have Si pudor est,
et de, which is neater, and less
vigorouS.

157 mum] Like⁰cultos in the next
line: the auctioneer has commenced
gentleman. The Scholiast has a
curious note on cultos :—“ Divitis
degener ·gladiatoris,'’ as if it was
unmanly of them not to be gladia-
tors too·

v 158 Pmnlrapi] The gladiator

matched with the Samnite. The
pinna was a trophy= “ Cum septem
incolumis pinnis redit ac recipit se‚'’
Lucilius -

, 161 sarcinulis] ‘ Collige sarci-
nulas ' was a form of divorce. It
would be convenient if it could be
made a general term for a wife’s
fortune ; but Achaintre, who makes
it equal to trousseau, is nearer right
than the Scholiast‚ who makes it
dos. Isso, instead of saying, “ He
gives her less than she brings him,''
he says, “He is not equal to giving
her a house to put her things in.’'

162 Quando-—Aedfflbus] Cf. sup.
47: Nulli comes exeo, n. Here he
complains οξ the difficulty of getting,
not an appomtment on a governor s
staff, but a berth as assessor to the
aediles, who were mere police magis-

trates. Such a ,position would add
to the respectability of a thriving

bourgeotir, and perhaps had some of - '3

the practical conveniences of being on
the vestry and the board of guardians.
Umbricius means that the poor gen·
tleman cannot make his way either.
at court, where he is ousted by
Greeks, or in business, where he
is cut out by freedmen.

163 Debuerant 011111 mlgrasse]
‘Olim’ carries the mind back to a
past time, at which it had long been
their duty to have emigrated, if, the
tenses can be tabulated in order of
succession, except in direct narra-
tive. In idiomatic English we might
say, “they had ought,” which is
exactly like ‘ debuerant,’ and means,
not that the duty had been long
incumbent, but that it was unper-
formed. Cf. inf. 315, note.
