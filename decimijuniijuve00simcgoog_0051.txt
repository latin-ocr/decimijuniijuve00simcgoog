INTRODUCTION. xlvii

follow dictation: e.g. at v. 60 we have magne for magnae, at

v. 82 amice for amicae, at v. 208 spirandtkque for spirantis-que

or spirantesque, at v. 2 3 1 ut legat storias for ut legat bistones,

just as in a note on Sat. 1. 1, which gives something like a life

of Juvenal, the line that caused his banishment is quoted as

f followS, Quod non dant proceres dabit strio. As these Scholia are

found in two MSS. at least, which often differ widely in their

readingS, it seems likely that our present copies are derived

from an archetype annotated from dictation when Juvenal was

still regularly taught in schools. It is even possible that the

same MS. may have contained the annotations of successive

,ἠ generations of pagan and Christian teacherS, for besides the

incongruous explanations quoted above, there is a note on

· xlv. 102, which implies that Tacitus is the only authority

accessible on the subject of Moses, while a note two lines

further on explains Quaesitum ad fontem of holy baptism.

But all speculations of this kind are most uncertain, for in

the absence of independent external evidence it is impossible

to limit the number of hypotheses which may be constructed

Α, to meet the limited facts. Still there can be little doubt

· that, in one form or another, the Scholia do contain the re-

f siduum of the old grammatical tradition, and this gives an

authority to their readingS, and even their interpretationS,

which is certainly not due to the intelligence of those who

have transmitted them to us, for Probus had access to many

.- authorities now lost, though he may not always have used
⁶ them critically.

The authority of Pithou’s MS. seems to rest largely on the
frequency of its blunders and the originality of its spelling,
which together seem to prove that any good reading which it
contains must rest wholly on its intermittent fidelity to a very

., ancient text. All the other MSS. are in C. F. Hermann's
