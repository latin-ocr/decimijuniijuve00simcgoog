He is certainly more spontaneous than Juvenal, and he cannot
have been so rough as Lucilius. But it is harder to determine
what is the precise bearing of the judgments of the ancients
upon one another, than to decide for ourselves in which of
his characteristics Juvenal and Persius were content to resemble
Horace, in what directions they sought a remedy for the short-
comings of their model. One contrast‚ indeed, is the result
of a difference, not in their aimS, but in their circumstances:
Horace, writing in the first instance for a limited circle, abounds
with allusions to persons whose names have been preserved by
him alone 3 Juvenal's butts recur far more constantly, and con·
tain a far larger proportion of public historical characters, while
PersiuS‚ who lived out of the world, draws his illustration
almost exclusively from literature. Subject to this limitation
Persius endeavoured to preserve the structure of the Horatian
Satire, with its free range of topicS, its arbitrary changes from
exhortation to anecdote and dialogue, its frank appropriation
os old literary effects, while he added the concentrated vigour
and the definite purpose in which his master seemed deficient.
Juvenal, on the contrary, simplifies the whole, while he

developes the parts, He rejects all direct quotation as likely
to disgust a jaded audience, and seeks the necessary interest
in emphasis rather than in condensation. The machinery of
dialogue is very much reduced in extent, and care is taken
that the reader shall never be puzzled by the way in which it is
employed. In Horace we are often perplexed how much space to
assign to each of the imaginary speakers 3 in Juvenal this ques·
tion is less perplexing, or rather less important3 he prefers to
sosten his transitions rather than to mark the limits of his
snatches of imaginary conversation. We might say perhaps that
there is almost the same proportion between the dramatic ele-
ment in Juvenal and the dramatic element in Horace, as there
is between Aristotle's method of discussing an ἀπορία and the
method of one of Plato’s dialogues. In Plato and Horace
the dramatic form exists for its own artistic value, and in
Horace its artistic value is not always great 3 in Juvenal the
