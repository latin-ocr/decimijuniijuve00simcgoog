in keeping before 'themselves and others the· principle that the
formation of character is the end of conduct and our main con· l
cern in life. Even Horace, with all his indolent and ostenta-
tious indecision between rival schools of philosophy, never
wavers in the conviction that salvation is to be found in the
true philosophy, and if this is unattainable, in the search for it,
His attitude was like the attitude of many in our day towards η
theology 3 he felt himself elevated and strengthened by the i

content to ridicule and share, to the ludicrous aspects of
Stoicism, which was too useful an auxiliary to be discarded,
and too grotesque and formal to be respected. Even Persius, εΑ

 

’ with all his gravity and his pathetic anxiety for sels-improve· ξ
