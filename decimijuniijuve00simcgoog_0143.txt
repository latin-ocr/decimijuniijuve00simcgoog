SATIRA X.

Interdum et' lacrimaS, quum Fortunae ipse minaci

{Mandaret laqueum, mediumque ostenderet unguem.
Ergo supervacua aut perniciosa petuntur-5·

Propter quae fas est genua incerare deorum-‘'⁶‘' ἅμ’

Quosdam praecipitat subjecta potentia magnae ὰ,
Invidiae3 mergit longa atque insignis honorum

Ipsas deinde rotas bigarum impacta securis

though mistaken conjecture, instead
of the ghost of the genuine reading.
The vulgate haec aut is merely an
‘old conjecture, lest in the text for
want of better. Lachmann reads

im rovement, and not too violent

55 m] So MSS. Madvig,
to avoid the difficulty of sas, sug-
gested incerate, which is hopeless y
abrupt. The line was meant to be
ironical. It is no sin to plaster the
knees of every god with rayers sor
these. Fas was a pe ectly con-
crete traditional code enjoining some
things·‚ allowing some, forbidding
others: of everything not forbidden
it might be said Fas est; with the
object either of accrediting the thing,
or, as here, of discrediting Fas.

cafflmn praecapitat means that they
topple over, under the stress of their
invidious power; mergit that under
the weight of their rank they sink
