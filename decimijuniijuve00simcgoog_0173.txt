SATIRA XII.

Nam praeter pelagi casus et fulminis ictus

Evasit. Densae coelum abscondere tenebrae

Nube una, subitusque antennas impulit igniS‚

Quum se quisque illo percussum crederet, et mox 20
Attonitus nullum conferri posse putaret

Naufragium velis ardentibus. Omnia fiunt

Talia, tam graviter, si quando poetica surgit

Tempestas. Genus ecce aliud discriminis: audi

Et miserere iterum: quanquam sint cetera sortis 2 5
Ejusdem pars dira quidem, sed cognita multiS‚

Et quam votiva testantur fana tabella

Plurima. Pictores quis nescit ab Iside pasci?

Accidit et nostro similis fortuna Catulle.

Quum plenus fluctu medius foret alveus, et jam, 30.
Alternum puppis latus evertentibus undis

Arboris incertae nullam prudentia cani

things are as bad” (they cannot be
worse). ·

ma²k5es a fresh aprieal to pietfissrlm 31¹2
ground that Catullus has suffered
loss as well as exceptional peril, and
immediately qualifies his appeal by
the admission that everybody who is
shipwrecked does lose his property.

28 Iside] A man ruined by a
shipwreck begged by exhibiting be·
sore the temple of Isis the icture
he was going to dedicate. C . 3—6.
Was it usual to make vows to orgi·
astic foreign deities, calm thank·
offerings to national gods? In the
time of Horace, od. 1. v. 13—16,
the votive picture was still dedi-
cated to Neptune.

32 Arboris lacertu] The passage
is elumsy upon any hypothesis: if
we retain the reading of P. it will·
be better to translate ‘the experience
of the gray steersman of the crazy
log' instead of putting arboris· in· ,
certae in apposition to puppis: there
is a plausible MS. variant, arboris
incerto, which may be taken either
with the previous line or with what
follows, meaning ‘as the tottering
mast made the shi roll’ or ‘ when no
skill could help t e tottering mast)
Lachmann has a pretty and credible
conjecture, Arbon· incertae. One is
tempted to suspect that the verses
about the storm and about Catullus‘
property, were written in parallel
columns, and that it was more or
less an accident where the second
should be inserted. If the mast
had been cut away immediately after
decidere jactu, there would be no
doubt as to the meaning of arbor,
which would unmistakably refer to
the mast. T aeda, inf. 59, is the only
colour for making arboris mean ship.
