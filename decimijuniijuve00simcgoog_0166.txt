D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ad quod lascivi ludebant ruris alumni.
Tales ergo cibi, qualis domus atque supellex.

Tunc rudis et Graias mirati nescius arteS,

100

Urbibus eversiS‚ praedarum in parte reperta
Magnorum artificum frangebat pocula mileS,
Ut ‘phaleris gauderet equuS, caelataque cassis
Romuleae simulacra ferae mansuescere jussae

Imperii fate, geminos sub rupe QuirinoS‚

105

Ac nudam effigiem clypeo venientis et hasta
Pendentisque Dei, perituro ostenderet hosti.
Argenti quod erat, solis fulgebat in armis,
Ponebant igitur Tusco farrata catino;

Omnia tunc quibus invideaS, si lividulus sis,

T emplorum quoque majestas praesentior, et vox
Nocte fere media, mediamque audita per urbem,

hard measure for the same beha-
viour; but asses are a worse substi-
tute for veal, than goats for venison.

99] In all, the MSS. Would be
better away.

100 miron] Almost‘ appreciate.’

101 praedaturum parte reperta]
Almost as if they shared the booty
into heaps of about the same size,
and then when each man had appro-
priated a heap they began to look
what was in them.

105 fato] Dative after mansues·
cere. Geminos—Quirino& so “gemi-
nus Pollux'’ (Hor. od. 111. xxix. 64).

106] There actually were re-
presentations of Mars hanging over
Ilia in his armour, which explains
pendentis better than to think of
him as fighting, though even as a
lover he looks terrible to the falling
enffyhudam] He is represented
Greek fashion without the breast-
plate or the kilt which completed it.

108] A group of MSS„ which

⁴{alm thinks interpolated‚ and mostly
ate shew their taste by omitting
this line, though it makes‘ igitur'
come in more naturally.

109] Is a more pointed repetition
of 99: one suspects that the author
wrote them as alternatives, and then
he or an editor unwilling to sacrifice
either found a place for both. T usco
catino is just the opposite of gulosum
fictile, sup. 19: it is the old-sasb-
ioned cheap ware to match the old· ·
fashioned cheap food.

1 13, 114] Galus vementibus—
Dls peragentibus] Two parallel pro·
di ‘eS.

{¹14 his monuit nos] These words
are awkward in themselves and it is a
choice of evils whether we are to ,
take them with what goes before or
what follows.· The punctuation of
the text is Heinrich's and has the
advantage of making audita a parti-
ciple instead of a verb: leis of course
will be an ablative absolute, things ⁸
being in this state. 1f we put the
