D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Flos Asiae ante ipsum, pretio majore paratus,
Quam fujt et Tulli census pugnacis 'et Anci,
Et, ne te teneam, Romanorum omnia regum

Frivola.
Respice, quum sities.

Quod quum ita sit, tu Gaetulum Ganymedem
Nescit tot millibus emtus

60

Pauperibus miscere puer: sed forma, sed aetas
Digna supercilio. Quando ad te pervenit ille Ρ
Quando vocatus adest calidae gelidaeque minister Ρ

Quippe indignatur veteri parere clienti,
Quodque aliquid poscas et quod se stante recumbaS.

65

Maxima quaeque domus servis est plena superbis,
Ecce, alius quanto porrexit murmure panem

Vix fractum, solidae jam mucida frusta farinae,

Quae genuinum agitent, non admittentia morsum!

Sed tener et niveus mollique siligine factus

hide his accomplices. Or perhaps
the meaning is, that you would take
him for a bogy ‘stealing from be-
hind a tomb if you caught sight of
him before you saw his master's
equipage : this view gives more

be that the uneven ground makes
the darkness more ⁶ eerie,' which
seems forced, though possible.

56 ante ipsum] The Romans lay
on sosas, to judge from bas-reliefs,
higher than the tables, and certainly
too high for the attendants to be
able to hand things over the shoulder,
as is done at a modern dinner3 be·
sides, it would be almost impossible
for a guest lying on his elbow to
{lake things so handed from be-

ind.

57] Cf. Hor. od. 1v. vii. 14, 15 ε
. “Nos ubi decidimus, Ι Quo pius
AEneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus-'³

62 mgna superante] Lit. ‘de-
serve the privilege of disdaim’ Give
him a right to be insolent.

, 63 etum meaeque] To suit

the warmth to the taste of the host
and the more favoured guests.

65 quod—poma, aa] The verbs
give lais two reasons sor indegnatur.
Juvenal’s would have been in the
indicative. cf. xv. 60 n. Mayor
seems to think that poscas and re-
cumbas are coordinate to paren.
If so, there is a sort of zeugma,
“ He is too indignant to attend to
you, and indignant that you are a
guest, with a claim on attention‚”
which is neither necessary nor im-

possible.
67 aum] “ Another ” of these

proud slaves. Why not the black
runner? because bread was handed
round once for all and every guest
is always calling for wine, all through
the dinner?

68 solidae] Proves that vix frac-
tum means ‘⁴ coarsely ground'' not
‘too hard to cut and hard enough to
break.’

69 Quae genuinum agitent]
“Stuff to work your cheek-teeth.''
It does not appear clear whether
they are wisc-teeth or grindem:
