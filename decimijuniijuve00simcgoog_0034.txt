esteem. Cotta seems to have been honestly in favour of a strict
and severe system of administration3 but only a system of con,-
sistent tolerance and mutual support could have enabled the
senate to hold its own against Tiberius—and Cotta is con-
demned accordingly. Juvenal does 'not differ from Tacitus in
his judgment on the rank and file of the delatura, who owed
their influence exclusively to their activity in providing the

, govemment with victims, Their activity in reality pressed quite

as severely on the bourgeoisie as on the aristocracy. Not im-
probably the government of a Domitian shed less blood for its
own protection in all the Roman empire than many of the
mediaeval tyrannies of Italy, and those not the worst, shed in a
single year. A large and active class of informers was hardly
required to provide for all the executions that we have reason
to suspect. But the exchequer which had to provide so many
largesses for spendthrift nobleS, for men of letters en disponi·
bilitcf, for the populace of the capital, always required to be
replenished ; and the delatores made it their business to replenish
it. The rights of the fiscus were as extensive and undefined
as the majesty of the emperor who represented the state: it
might almost be said that the means for enforcing them were as
inadequate. A single advocatus fisci here and there who might

be seduced or intimidated was not enough to enforce the multi-

plicity of claims which the inventive ingenuity of· the crown ·

lawyers had revived or established a priori. The result was
that even in the fourth century there were great numbers of
respectable people in the habitual enJ’oyment of >what might
be plausibly represented as due to the emperor. These were
imperfectly reassured when a well-intentioned sovereign decreed

, that the informers should be punished if they prosecuted with-

out the sanction of the advocatus fisci, though of course it was
possible for private persons to ascertain the instructions and to
calculate the action of a known and responsible official. Under
Domitian and other emperors wh0, as Domitian himself observed,
encouraged informers by neglecting to discourage them, it was
impossible for a senator to feel that his property was his own, it
