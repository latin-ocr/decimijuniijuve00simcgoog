D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Ova adsunt ipsis cum matribuS, et servatae

Parte anni, quales fuerant in vitibus, uvae:

Signinum Syriumque pirum, de corbibus isdem

Aemula Picenis et odoris mala recentiS,

Nec metuenda tibi, siccatum frigore postquam 7 5

Autumnum et crudi posuere pericula succi.

Haec olim nostri jam luxuriosa Senatus

Coena suit. CuriuS, parvo quae legerat hort0,

Ipse focis brevibus ponebat oluscula, quae nunc

Squalidus in magna fastidit compede fossor, 80
Qui meminit, calidae sapiat quid vulva popinae.

Sicci terga suiS, rara pendentia crate,

Moris erat quondam festis servare diebus

Et natalicium cognatis ponere lardum,

Accedente nova, si quam dabat hostia, carne. 85
Cognatorum aliquis titulo ter consulis atque

72 Puteum] “By the season ;'’
“By the cold of late autumn and
early winter.” It is as well to keep
to the common instrumenta] sense
of the ablative3 as the abl. is seldom
used of duration‚ though instances
are found, as Cic. N.'D. ii. ᾖ 130.
—Quales fuerant in vitibus, i. e.
not as raisins. Grapes were pre-
served in air-tight casks, or sawdust,
or hung up. and sometimes smoked
(Plin. H. JV. xv. 18; Varro, R. R.
i. 54). The last process would give
raisms.

73 «ιο corbibus neem] “The
fruit is brought up in baskets. Of
these there are no more than ne-
cessary” (Mayor).

74, 75] “The fruit is fresh, as
having been carefully packed 3 whole-
some, as having been kept so long. '’

78, 79] One learns of Curius:
that he had neither cook nor gardener
(aps-e and lgerath that he dined off
ξξῗξῗξξῃὲζῖέἑὲᾅΐ ὸςὶἶὲἒεῆἶρὲὶῖῖ

80, squmdus] Beoeuse he is out
of reach of baths-

81] ‘⁴ Who can remember the taste
of a sow’s paunchin a steaming cook·
shop‚'‘ which he used to frequent be·
fore he was banished from the city
establishment: very likely he was
banished artly for frequenting it.
Probably 81 are reminiscences of
Hor. Sat. 11. vii. 118, Ep. 1. xiv.
¹⁵5²⁵ias21 Constructed to hold
few flitches.

84 natalicium] ‘⁸ For a birthday
feast‚” in honour of the genius;
hence ‘hostia.' The sacrificial
notion of a feast is very clearly
given in Aen. iii. 221, 222 :—

“ Divosque ipsumque voca-
Inrggjtem praedamque Jovem.'’

Men were afraid to seed themselves
before the gods. The inadequacy.
of this view is exposed in the Psalms
and Prophets.
