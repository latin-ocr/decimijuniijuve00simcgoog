42—45] Gems, with a mythical
pedigree, eked out from Virgil (Aen.
iv. 260), are transferred from the
scabbard to the fingers, and at last
to a goblet.

45 juvenis] As an English satirist
might say, ‘the swain ;' he does not
mean that AEneas was young, but
that he was Dido's ‘ young man.’

47] “A cup, with four lips or
spouts, modelled on the long nose
of Vatinius, a favourite of Nero,
the craeked glass‘ of which calls out
for sulphur.'' Cf. Martial, 1. xlii. 3,
4 sqq· ² ‚

“ Transtiberinus ambulator

Qui pallentia sulfurata fractis

Permutat vitreis-..³²

Instead of simply cementing broken
glass, they made a new ware, with
a pale yellow surface, and changed
this as required sor the raw material.
nasorum quatuor] This is an
aggravatiom the cup has four spouts
that one guest may drink from each.

Perhaps it is hardly going too far
to infer from u‘ccabzls· that Trebius
has to be content with the heel-taps3
in order that each guest should have
a cup or goblet of his own, it was
necesislary that they all should sit up
to ta e.

50 decocta] Water boiled and
cooled in snow was convenient, even
in winter, to hard drinkers, who
suffered from internal heat.

51} Would be better away,
and. though it would mend matters
a little to put it after 48, this is not
what Juvenal intended. Non eadem
...aquam is a perfectly appropriate
and spirited introduction to a'new
contract between host and guest;
the fault is, that instead of following
it up, the writer has foisted in two
lines just before, also ,excellent in
themselveS, which complete the
sense but destroy the connexion.
