was impossible sor the class which stood below the senators to
count upon receiving the legacies which might be left them,
when Caesar administered to the estate of every man who had
ever been heard to say that Caesar would be his heir. We
are left to form our opinion of the rapacity of the imperial
·government from a good deal of general declamation and from
one‘ or two specific instanceS, doubtless taken from 'extreme

’ cases· It is probable that the material loss was not what the

-Ro'mans chased at most ς both Roman commoners and Roman
nobles when they spoke of liberty meant what they said: the

we find him even more reactionary than Tacitus more sincere,
·a'nd more uncompromising in his regrets for the simplicity
of the past. This is one proof among many that the side of

and the oligarchy, or at least to keep themselves aloof from the
excesses of both: their ideas of culture excited as much oppo-

conservative frugality of the rich. The first proved, as might be
expected, the more durable obstacle of the two, Juvenal railed
heartily against tortoiseshell sosas while Tacitus complacently
bewailed the impossibility of suppressing luxury. In general it ·
may be said that Juvenal is one of the satirists who endeavour

³ <to combat vice by consecrating prejudice. He is of the family

of ’ Aristophanes and Moliere, not of Lucian and ErasmuS, of
Rabelais ·and Voltaire. It may be reckoned either as his merit
