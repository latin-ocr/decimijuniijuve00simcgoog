64 jam sexta] Soon·he may ride
in an octophorus, as he does already
in a hexaphorus. VVere the bearers

65 nuda. paene cathedra] So like
a woman as to enjoy the impropriety
of ex re. In the ‘sella you sat,
in the ‘lectica’ you lay at length, in
the ‘cathedra’ (which was all but
appropi-Iialtled to women) you were
a e o o .

66.] Reminding you strongly of
the way in which Maecenas used to
sprawl. The line will be more

iquant if we suppose that the fel-
lbw had flatterers who compared
him to Maecenas, and that Juvenal
’ retends to see the resemblance so
ar as it is not flattering.

67 signator] A forger of attes-
tations. Probably here he sorges
the will, as well as witnesses it, as
his fortune and gentility (lautum)
cost a small pair of tablets‚ as well
as the trouble of damping his ring,
to geta clean impression.

70—72.] When her husband is
thirsty, and she has to hand him
some mild wine, she puts the bram-
ble frog in, and teaches her country

cousins to brave the public voice·

and eye ( per famam etpopulum)‚' as'
they bury ihe'ir husbandS, whose
‚faces were blackened ,with poison.
71 Deusta] A Gaulish vwoman,
helped to· remove Claudius and
Britannicus, and was sacrificed by

Galba, with other creatures of -

Nero. Μὲἱέον, because it was more
respectable to have deal-ings with a
