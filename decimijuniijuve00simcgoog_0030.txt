capesserd (Hist. ιν. 5). But it is certain from more than one
passage that he had succeeded in arranging his own lise without
the support* of convictions though not without the stimulus· of
idoes. ¹As these ideas were mostly borrowed from the Porch,
it would be possible sor a careless raeder to class him among
the disciples of Zeno, It would be hard to make the same
mistake about Juvenal: there is indeed one satire, the fifteenth‚
where he appeals to Stoicism with as much respect as a satirist
can appeal to any authority ; there are others, like the fourth
and tenth, where he uses Stoical ideas without anything apa
proaching to a disclaimer of the authority of the reigning phi·
losophy: though even in the tenth the distinction between true
and false goods, upon which the whole satire turns, is really
Socratic rather than Stoioel: in fact the distinction between real
and apparent prosperity vanishes as soon as it has been laid
down that everything externa] is ideally indifferent. Moreover,
there are passages like 111. 116 sq.‚ xm. 120 sq„ where the writer
'shows an unmistakeable animus against Stoicism, or at least

against Stoics. One cannot tell how far he may have beeri
disgusted by the inconsistencies of individuals, and there is no
doubt that such scandals were very groSS, and far from rare ς,
but, in fact, their pretensions were intolerable to all but those
who felt that they too were philosophers 3 their demands upon
human nature were too severe for any man to accept honestly
who was not heartily in earnest about his own character, a
subject which seldom interests a satirist.

Another point in which Juvenal and Tacitus in the main
coincide is their indignation against the delatores ‚· a pest which

has had 'its analogues, under every tyranny. At Rome it
assumed a peculiar form owing to several circumstances», of

which the most important were the hypocrisy of the Caesars in
retaining the forms of a republic and the absence os any system
of state police. The tyranny of a bad emperor was irresistible5
bu‘t it was far from being omnipresent: the government of the
senate and* the equestrian order had proved itself inadequate to
