SATIRA XIII. 133

Effigies inter vestras statuamque Vagelli.”
Accipe quae contra valeat solatia ferre,
Et qui nec CynicOS, nec Stoica dogmata legit
A Cynicis tunica distantia, non Epicurum
Suspicit exigui laetum plantaribus horti.
Curentur dubii medicis maJ'oribus aegri:
Tu venam vel discipulo committe Philippi.
Si nullum in terris tam detestabile factum
Ostendis, taceo, nec pugnis caedere pectus
Te veto, nec plana faciem contundere palma
Quandoquidem accepto claudenda est janua damn0,
Et majore domus gemitu, majore tumultu r 30
Planguntur nummi, quam funera. Nemo dolorem
Fingit in hoc casu, vestem diducere summam ’
Contentus, vexare oculos humore coacto,
Ploratur lacrimis amissa pecunia veriS. '

nothing could make his statue speak.
122 A—tustantta] The Cynics
made the emancipation of the in-
dividual the end of philosophy. and
sougbt it simply by the rejection of
superfiuities: accordingly they wore
the pallium double and dis ensed
with the tunic; the Stoics he d that
man should not live sor himself
alone3 they selt that the decencies
of society were a part of the order
of the world, accordingly they re-
sumed the tunic while they main-
tained the protest against super-
fluities by wearing a coarse cloak.
It is worth noticing that the early
Buddhist ascetics who regarded as·
ceticism as a means for the salvation
of the world were models of decorum,
while the contemporary Brahmani-
cal ascetics for whom asceticism was

obtrusive mortifications

1²3 exigua-horti] As Epicurus
was so easily pleased he would
never have thrown himself into an
excitement about a hundred pounds;
his name is introduced to shew that
both the sects in vogue were in-,
dependent enough of circumstances
to rebuke Calvinus.

prentice.’'

127 pugnis] To make a good
noise.

128 plana] For you don’t want
to hurt yourself after all.

129 mandenda eet] As we pull
downraflinds between a death and a
sune .

13² vestem diducere summam]
“To part the upper edge of the
tunic.'’ N.B., ‘diducere,' not ‘di-
