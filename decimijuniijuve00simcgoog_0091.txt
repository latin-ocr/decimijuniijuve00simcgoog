SATIRA IV.

Anne aliud tunc praefecti? quorum optimus atque
Interpres legum sanctissimus; omnia quanquam
Temporibus diris tractanda putabat inermi
Justitia. Venit et Crispi jucunda senectuS,
Cujus erant moreS, qualis facundia, mite
Ingenium. Maria ac terras populosque regenti
Quis comes utilior, si clade et peste sub illa
Saevitiam damnare et honestum afferre liceret
Consilium? Sed quid violentius aure tyranni,
Cum quo de pluviis aut aestibus aut nimboso

favourites.’'

81 crispi] Tacitus places Vibius
Crispus “inter claros magis quam
inter bonos'’ (Hist. ii. 10), and re-
praeents him as a temptation to the
old (iv. 42). Quintilian is content
to praise his regular and harmonicus

thinks they got their information

capable of such a sacrifice.”

95 tam saeva, αα] This seems
to point to a somewhat different
story of his death to that generally
received. According to the latter,
he was condemned to the arena,
came off victoriouS, was exiled,·and
put to death in banishment.
