(Mart. xrr..18. ι). As none of these epigrams contain ” any*
allusion to our Juvenal’s career as a satixist, as the gentlemanly.
mendioency implied in the latest epigram is incompatible
· with the statement of the biographers that he could go on
wit-h the stu dy of declamation for amusement till middle life,
and with his own allusions to a modest competence, and as
Juvenal himself says nothing of Martial, I am inclinem: to
believe that there were two Juvenals who lived at Rome in·
the time of Martial.

On the whole, therefore, it is not impossible that Juvenal
was born about 20 or 30 mn„ and lived into Trajan’s reign,
which would make him seventy or eighty years old at the ,con-
demnation of Marius PriscuS,—the one date we are able to fix
with confidence in the whole of Juvenal's life. He began to
write in the last years of Nero, and probably had prepared
most of the materials which he finally placed in the First and
Eighth Satire5‚ and the rough draughts of otherS, before he
published the little jeu d'esprit on the actor Paris· Perhaps
also it would follow that the comparative repose and elevation
of Satires x—xw. are due rather to the tranquillising influence
of the reigns of Vespasian and Titus than to the mellowing
influence of advancing years· Before A. D. 84, he had poems

of Satire vn„ now pointed against the favourite of Domitian,
who had just been sacrificed to the jealousy of his master.
In that year he was banished to Egypt, probably for six monthS,
and there witnessed the savage outbreak of fanaticism which-
is recorded in the Fisteenth Satire. He returned to Rome in

a state of suppressed indignation against the tyrant who had ¹

appropriated a doubtful compliment to a fallen favourite 'as
a reflection on his own good government, while he had entirely
disregarded the decorous homage to himself, with which the
satire opens, He was able to take a full revenge after Domi-
tian's death, by the publication of the Fourth Satire in its
present form. The additions, on this hypothesiS, must be taken
as a proof that, like Landor, Juvenal retained his energy as
