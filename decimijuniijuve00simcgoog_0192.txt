138 D. J-UNH JUVENALIS

Mens et an hoc illi facinus ἱ suaderet Apollo Ρ v
Reddidit ergo, metu, non moribus3 et tamen omnem

Vocem adyti dignam templo veramque probavit
Exstinctus tota pariter curn prole domoque

Et, quamvis longa deductis gente, propinquis·

Has patitur poenas peccandi sola voluntas,

Nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum,

Facti crimen habet. “ Cedo, si conata peregit ?” 2 10
Perpetua anxietas nec mensae tempore cessat, ‘¹

Faucibus, ut morbo, siccis interque molares
Difficili crescente cibo: sed vina misellus

Exspuit3 Albani veteris pretiosa senectus ,

Displicet3 ostendas meliuS‚ densissima ruga ἐ 2 15
Cogitur in frontem, velut acri ducta Falern0. '
Nocte brevem si forte indulsit cura soporem,

Et toto versata· toro jam membra quiescunt: ’

Continuo templum et violati numinis aras .. ⁸
Et, quod praecipuis mentem sudoribus urget, 220
Te videt in somnis ς tua sacra et major imago '
Humana turbat pavidum cogitque fateri.

Hi sunt, qui trepidant et ad omnia fulgura pallent,

206 pariter] Sc. ac si juravisset.
207] “ However far you had to go
back to prove the connection,'' i. e..
however remote it might be.
208—211] He seems to mean
that providentia] punishment follows
the resolve: execution has a further
punishment in the fear of detection.
213 Dlfflcffl crescente cibo] The
sood is a difficulty which seems to
grow because it does not vanish. -Sed
vina, so all the MSS. Setina is
a very pretty conjecture, which no
copyist had any temptation to alter.
Sed comes as near as it ever does ¹to
tamen—though his mouth is parch-
ed and his food sticks in his throat,
he cannot wash it down with wine.
216 acri] Horace gives the im-

pression that F alernian was valued
in his day, but this was only sor its
strength and when it was matured
by keeping.

221, 222 tua — humana] This
phantom is related to the person it·
represents as Peter's angel to Peter*
in the belief of the then Church ;'
death is not presupposed in either
case. Cf. Uerg. Aen. iv. 465:

. “Agit ipse furentem
In somnis ferus Aeneasss’

-Major humana, cf. Verg. Aen. ii.
772, nota major imag-0, where also
Creusa is as much wraith or double

tinguish physical susceptibility to*
