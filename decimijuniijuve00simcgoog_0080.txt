218] ⁶ Phaecasianorum ' is the
reading of most M SS. ‘ Haec Asia·
norum,’ which looks like a correc-
tion of the text, is found in P. and
the Scholiast. If it is right, the
women join the collection as well as
the mourning; but their solitary re·

· presentative looks forlorn among so

many men. Hence Jahn reads hic,
which would be quite unobjection·
able, if Juvenal had written it; and
others try to make haec neuter.
It is very difficult to guess what
gods could be characterized by the
white woollen shoes of Athenian or
Alexandrine priests; but “potior
est lectio difficill1ma.”

219] As other friends, 216—218,
have furnished the gymnasium, this
one furnishes the library.

Ι 220 motuum argenti] About two
gallons of small change worth eight
hundred or a thousand pounds. Cf.
l-Ior. S. 1. i. 96, dives Ut metiretur
nummos. After Conferat impensas
(sup. 216), symmetry requires a con·
tribution in money in addition to
those in kind.

221 orborum lautissimus] So

that he lives in better style than any
other orbus.

222 suspectus, tanquam aa]
This use of tanquam, which is sre-
quent in the Silver Age, does not
imply the injustice of the suspicion,
accusation, &c., as a clause with
tanquam may either state the reason
of an unjust charge or the nature of
a ‘ust.

J224 paratur] “ Is bought.” Con·
trast i. 105, 106:

“ Quinque tabernae
Quadringenta parant.’'

225 tenebras] A dark smoky
garret.

226—229] “Every thing is on a
diminutive seale‚—the garden, the
young plantS, that want all the water
they get from the shallow well, that
needs no rope to the bucket; still,
if you stick to it you can get a dinner
out of it that would be an event to
a hundred Pythagoreans. ’' The water
is drawn with a swipe instead of a
windlass; as it is turned out of the
bucket it runs down along the little
trenches between the little beds.
