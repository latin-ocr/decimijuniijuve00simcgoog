240—244 non Leucade]= So the
majority of MSS. including the
corrector of P. The scholiast and
P. and some others read in. Jahn
conjectures sibi, which suits sense,
grammar and metre3 in suits the
sense, but presents visible metrical
and undeniable grammatical difficul-
ties3 if we read non we must sup·
pose that Juvenal made a not wholly
successful attempt to say that Oc-
tavian owed the high title of pater
patriae not, as his flatterers pretend·
ed, to his victory over the apostate
Roman who had leagued himself

with Cleopatra, but to his success
in destroying the ¹last republican
army at Philippi.

Both Octavian and Cicero were
hailedpater patriae ,· but in Cicero's
case it was the voice of Rome, not
of a distant battle-field3 os peace,
not of war 3 of liberty, not of
slavery.—leessaliae campis. The
Romans believed that' the battles
of Philippi were fought on the
same ground as Pharsalia, from the
ambiguity of bis and iterum, and the
inaccurate use of Aemathia (Verg.
Goer. i. 489, 491).

247, 248] When the verb which
expresses the condition is in the
subjunctive, and the principal verb
is the indicative, the principal clause
is really independent. The condi-
tional clause is added as a correc-
tion, and implies a suppressed
apodosis also in the subjunctive: do·
labra would be used to point 'the
stakes sor the vallum.
