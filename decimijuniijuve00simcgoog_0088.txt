34 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

Purpureus magni ructarit scurra Palati,

Jam princeps equitum, magna qui voce solebat

Vendere municipes fracta de merce siluros!

Incipe, Calliope, licet et considere: non est

Cantandum, res vera agitur ε narrate, puellae 3 ς
Pierides: prosit mihi vos dixisse puellas!

· Quum jam semianimum laceraret Flavius orbem

Ultimus et calvo serviret Roma Neroni,

Incidit Adriaci spatium admirabile thom-bi*

Ante domum Veneris, quam Dorica sustinet Ancon, 40
Implevitque sinus: neque enim minor haeserat illis,

Quos operit glacies Maeotica, ruptaque tandem

Solibus effundit torrentis ad ostia Ponti,

31 rui-puteus scurra] This is
the most definite indication which
Juvenal gives anywhere of the foun-
dation on which the influence of the
person he calls Crispinus tested.
Domitian was gloomy: it seems a

rson whom he allowed to amuse

im could establish an ascendancy
over him. α

32 pnnoopa equitum] This al-
most makes one suspect that the
lolling like Maecenas (1. 66) was
originall
though Juvenal evenmally decided
to father it upon an anonymous
stffitator. F latterers of Domitian
would naturally compliment him on
the resemblance of his easy-going
useful favourite to the Minister of
Augustus: the title may imply that
he was praefictus praetorio.

37, 38] The Scholiast says that
Juvenal wrote these lines to revenge
his banishment. This nickname of
Domitian seems to have passed into
a proverb, at least Ausonius quotes
it as such (Monost. 6; XII. Imp.
11, 12).

37 jam] probably goes with semi-
animum, not with ultimus, though
that is possible. Nero had knock-
ed half the life out of the world, and
Domitian was mangling the remain-
der. It is worth noticing that on
neither view does the writer make
any allowance for Vespasian or Ti·
tus, though the one retained respect
and the other roused enthusiasm.

40 Mea] Founded by Syra-
cusan refugees in the reign of
Dionysius.

the strong current of the Bosporus,
so Plin (H. Ν. ix. 20 [15] speaks
of the hysh caught in Euripo Threicii
Bospori. There are other passages
which speak of the fish streaming
through the straita.
