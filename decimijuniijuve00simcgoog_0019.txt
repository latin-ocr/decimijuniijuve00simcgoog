survived'· its cause( Some old copyists seem to have felt*
a'tharaedo principe as a difficulty after Nero’s death; hence=
the gloss natus, which has replaced mimus in most MSS. It·
remains to explain the allusion to Lateranus, as of age to ’
defend Nero, and the address to Rubellius Plautus or Blandus,
In the first place, we may observe that the general and shame·
less relaxation of manners suits better with the age of Nero
than with that of Domitian, the reviver os the censorship 3 in
the second place, Lateranus must obviously be a contemporary*
of Ner03 in the third place, it is exceedingly improbable that
the younger Blandus (if there ever was one) could be the child·
of an imperial mother 3 because if Plautus, like his father, had
married into the imperial family, Tacitus would have mentioned

when he altered the name. If this hypothesis seems com·
plioeted, it must be remembered that all the MSS. have Blande

· or Plance, while Plaute rests only on the high authority of
Lipsius3 that the hero of the second Dunciad, in addition. to
his own sinS, has to endure much inappropriate invective due
to the peculiar dulness of the hero of the first 3 and that what

to Juvenal in a passing digression.

ι One piece of evidence still remains for notice,—-—the allusions
in Martial to a Juvenal with whom he lived on terms of
affectionate familiarity at Rome, when he published his Seventh
Book (where the twenty-fourth epigram is addressed to Juvenal,

T> and the ninety-first alludes to him), and who was still pre-
sumably at Rome as a restless suitor for preferment in the

t, beginning of T rajan’s reign, while Martial, having given up
