'xiv INTRODUCTION.

<and that Juvenal was indulging in a rather flat mystification,
when he introduced an imaginary Mentor to warn him of the
danger of denouncing Tigellinus, and propitiates his phantom
monitor by a promise only to attack the dead. For if Tigel-
linus is merely the disguise of another reigning favourite, it

would be necessary to prove, in the first place, that Trajan ·

had a favourite who had power to persecute3 and impossible
to prove, in the second place, that any danger of the kind,
which may have existed, could ‚be avoided by only admitting
names whose owners had departed3 for Tigellinus had been

dead nearly forty years 3 and the warning implies that his name ·

was a transparent pseudonym for some well-known character,
whom Juvenal’s public were certain to recognize as the evil
genius of Trajan. If we suppose that the real Tigellinus was
meant, the allusion to Crispinus, in v. 27, is no objection to
the theory that most of the satire was written under Nem, who
raised Crispinus to the senate, according to Probus, though
his fortune culminated under Domitian.

The date of the Eighth Satire is yet more ambiguous
Besides the allusions already discussed to the Euphrates and
the eagles which control the Batavian, we read (167—171)

how Lateranus goes to drink in the tavern and seed with its·

greasy napkinS‚ though he is of age for the wars of Armenia
and Syria, for the desence of the river Danube and the river
Rhine3 old enough, in fact, to guarantee the security of Nero.
Further on, at v. 193, the author speaks of his contemporaries
as selling themselves to the stage and the arena, without a
Nero to compel them ; and at v. 221, we are informed that
the musical tastes of Nero were the worst atrocity which called
for the >righteous vengeance of Vindex and Galba. of course
. these last lines must have been written after Nero’s death3
and they explain the ambiguity of v. 198, where citharaedo
principe, &c must mean after an emperor had taken to music ς,
what wonder that the nobility took to pantomime? for nullo
cogente Nerone must be taken as a proof that the shameful
devotion of men of rank to the stage was an effect which had.
