carried his new branch of the Via
Appia, to meet the local roads of
the district cf Baiae.

5 Ego vel Prochytam praepono
Suburae] Juvenal names Prochyta,
a bare volcanic island then unculti-
vated, as the most unattractive place
in the neighbourhood of Cumae,

quilias a ferventi migrare Subura.’'

Cf. xiv. 94, 95 ε

“Totam hanc turbavit filius
amens,

Dum meliore novas attollit
marmore villas.’'

temporary event be equally con-
tiuuous, it attracts the clause with
dum into the past. tense ; so, ‘⁶ Dum
