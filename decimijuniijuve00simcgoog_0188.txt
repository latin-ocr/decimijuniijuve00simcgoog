Sed si cuncta vides simili fora plena querela,

si, decies lectis diversa parte tabellis,

Vana supervacui dicunt chirographa ligni,
Arguit ipsorum quos litera gemmaque princeps
Sardonychum, loculis quae custoditur eburnis:

Ten’, O delicias, extra communia censes

Ponendum Ρ Qui tu gallinae filius albae,

Nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis Ρ

Rem pateris modicam et mediocri bile ferendam,
Si flectas oculos majora ad crimina. Confer

Conductum latronem, incendia sulfure coepta
Atque dolo, primOS quum janua colligit ignes:

Confer et hoS, veteris qui tollunt grandia templi
Pocula adorandae robiginis et populorum
Dona vel antiquo positas a rege coronas.

Haec ibi si non sunt, minor exstat sacrilegus, qui

136 «nvem purte] “On the
other side.”

137] Is repeated (xvi. 41).

138 princeps] Hence well known,
and a proos of wealth.

140 deumne] “My dainty dear,’²
not “what dainty airs‚” as Juvenal
is always goodnatured to his friend.

¹41 smum—nme] A white
hen‘s egg was rare, like a white
elephant. A white hen carried off by
an eagle, and dropt in Livia's lap,

brood and a large one afterwards;
in general silver-spangled hens re-
fuse to sit.

143 terendam = ‘Quam feras·
(εέεε note x. 141), εὐφόρητον ἂν γινο-

145 conductum] Hired to fire
and rob the house. It seems proba-

—- sulfure] Not by charcoal.

146 dolo] Not by chance.—
firma, a point very convenient for
the incendiaq, where no chance fire
could begin.

147 templi} It is not clear where
the temple is supposed to be z

once of the offerings by kings and
subject states which would be
dedioeted in temples at Rome, and
of the offerings at Delphi and
Olympia, some of which would be
as old as Croesus and Midas.

148 adorandae robiginis] There
