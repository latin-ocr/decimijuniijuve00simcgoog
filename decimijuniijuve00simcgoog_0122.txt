1 Stemmata] The Romans had
two ways of proclaiming their de-
scent z one was to have painted
waxen masks of the face and bust
in niches in the ‘atrium.’ To this
mauritanae, 25:21 aar
nus with the shoulders gone,
triumphal statues of the younger
Africanus: the other, to have a great
chart, with enwreathed medallions
connected by lines, on which the
titles of the portraits were written.
6—8 allude to this3 hence Her-
mann cannot be allowed to omit 5, 6,
to make way for 7. Th'e represen-
tative of an old family which had
maintained its state would have both
the ‘images’ and the chart, the
second to serve as a key to the first3
but a man who had made his own
position, though his ancient pedigree
might be genuine, would have no
‘ images ε’ he would have a chart of
the kind described above, and per-
haps-statues of the most distinguish-
ed of those whom he claimed as his
ancestors. Plin. xxxv. 2 ἓ 6 speaks
of statues in atria as an innovation-
As late as the time of Polybius, vi.
53, the ‘images’ of a man’s deceased

ancestors were worn at funerals by
attendants who personated them.

minded of this family, which he
knew to be noble, by the fact that
a Galba had lately been emperor;
but his private images would be still
entire.

have just had Corvinus before.

Many MSS. omit it, perhaps by·

the authority of Juvenal ’s literary
executors, but it is not like a gloss;
and capaci is no objection, as a
pedigree, which went so far back,
would have to be wide enough to

include many collateral lines of κ

desceut3 and posthac multa con·
fingere virga is very nearly equivalent

m sense to multa contingendas virga. ³

It is translated, ‘⁶ to have affinity
through many ancestors, who bare
the fasces.'' So the Scholiast, and
F orcellini. Ruperti: “ To have
affinity through many a branch of
the genealogical tree.” So Pers.
iii. 28: ‘⁶ Stemmate quod Tusoo
ramum millesime ducis,’' which is
a neat, and not a violent guess.
Heinrich: “To dust with a great
deal of broom.'' Hermann: “To
