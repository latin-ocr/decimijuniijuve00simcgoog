Castrorum imperiis et dictatoris honore

FunctuS, ad has epulas solito maturius ibat,

Erectum domito referens a monte ligonem.

Quum tremerent autem Fabios durumque Catonem 90
Et Scauros et FabriciOS, postremo severos

Censoris mores ‘etiam collega timeret:

Nemo inter curas et seria duxit habendum,

Qualis in Oceano fluctu testudo nataret,

Clarum Trojugenis factura ac nobile fulcrum: 95

Sed nudo latere et parvis frons aerea lectis
Vile coronati caput ostendebat aselli,

87 castrorum imperils] If this
mean anything more than military
commands, it will be a sneer on
Domitian and the other Imperatores
who owed the title to anything but
their victories.

90 autem] seems to refer to 77,
78. If so, Curius—ltgonem is an
overgrown parenthesis3 and the
connexion will be. “This was the
way our senate supped when luxury
was coming in (to be sure, Curius
lived on pot· -,herbs with bacon for
a treat on birthdays, and his dis-
tinguished friends were glad to join
him). ‚On the other hand, when
a Fabius, a Scaurus, and the rest
were left to keep the world‘ m awe,
no one thought seriously of tortoise-

shell couchesff'
. —· Fabios] The Scholiast has a
story that Q. Fabius Maximus when
censor told P. Decius his colleague
either to reform the state himself or
leave him to do so. The story is
hardly invented from this passage
and is quite in the style of the lovers’
quarrels in Livy x. 24, though he
with finer artistic sense keeps them
'for the close of their career. It is

91 Scauros] refers to M. Aemi·
lius», consul B.C. 1 15 (when he passed

a sumptuary law against eating dor-
mice), censor B-C. 109. His dili-
gence, tact‚ and decorum, gave him
immense influence in his life, and
his posthumous reputation was the
higher, because he was the last
statesman who proved capable of
administering affairs in the interest
of the nobility.

92] Juvenal sees the discreditable
quarrel of M. Livius Salinator and
C. Claudius Nero, B.C. 204, through
an antiquarian hale.

94 Oceano fluctu] Ocean-wave.
Oceanum mare is frequent.

95] They think this silly ostenta-
tion due to their imaginary dignity.

96] The meaning is, “Lectus
parvus nudo latere et fronte aerea 3 '²
but the sentence is so turned, as to
throw aerea into the nom„ and
bring out the contrast with testudo.
Nudo latere means not without, a
side· rail, but the side plain. Frons

- aerea is the head, which had a cheap

design of satyrs playing round an
ass' s head, unless we are to under-
stand country children play ing about
the feasters like satyrs.

97 coronati] With vine-leaves,
as sacred to Bacchus3 for the ass
either discovered the sweetness os
the vine, or the benefit of pruning
vineyards by nibbling the leaves.
