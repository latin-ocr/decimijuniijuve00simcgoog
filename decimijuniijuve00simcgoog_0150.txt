the ordinary Roman education; it
was as exceptional for a Roman
gentleman to be well acquainted
with Greek and Oriental historians,
as for an English gentleman twenty
years ago to be acquainted with
writers on natural science.

suit Herodotus (vii. 120), whence it
appears that the army took no meal
except after the evemng halt.

183] A Persian trained to minis·
ter dutifully to running streams of
sweet water, would be peculiarly
liable to this reaction against ‘⁸ the
bitter river ” of the Hellespont (Her.
vii. 25). To suit Herodotus, WeBer
conjectures “Quid Ρ non et stigmate
dignum Credidit?'' which Juvenal
had some roeson to write, the copy·
ists no reason to change. The fact
is Juvenal had read Sostratus and
Sostratus had read Herodotus, from
whom he repeated positively the
story of the chaining and scourging
and expressed Pindaric disbelief of
the branding which Herodotus
mentioned doubtfully. It is possi·
ble of 'course that the story os the
chaining arose from inflated language
about· the bridge over the Helles·
pont. Cf. Aesch. Pers. 87 sqq. δόκι·
μσς οὔτις ὑποστάς μεγάλῳ ῥεύμα-
τι φωτῶν ἐχυροῖς ἕρκεσιν εἴργειν ἅμα·
χον κῦμα θαλάσσας. It should be
added that up to the present time
all our knowledge of Sostratus is
derived from the present passage.
He probably competed with success
for a Greek Prize at Domitian’s
Agon Capitolinus.
