SATIRA , x1.

115⁴

Non Phryx aut Lycius, non a mangone petitus
Quisquam erit3 in magno quum posceS, posce Latine.
Idem habitus cunctiS, tonsi rectique capilli,

Atque hodie tantum propter convivia pexi.

150

Pastoris duri est hic filius, ille bubulci:
Suspirat longo non visam tempore matrem
Et casulum, et notos tristis desiderat haedos,
Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoriS,

Quales esse decet, quos ardens purpura vestit:

155

Nec pupillares defert in balnea raucus
TesticuIOS, nec xvellendas jam praebuit alaS,

Crassa nec opposito pavidus tegit inguina gutte.
Hic tibi vina, dabit, diffusa in montibus illis,

A quibus ipse venit, quorum sub vertice lusit:

160

Namque una atque' eadem est vini patria atque ministri.
Forsitan exspecteS, ut Gaditana canoro

Incipiat prurire chore, plausuque probatae

Ad terram tremulo descendant clune puellae z

Spectant hoc nuptae juxta recubante marit0,

elad, being used to live' out of
doorS. ·

148 in magno quum posces]
“When you >call ‚for 'a bumper.''
Most MSS. give the obvious guess
et magno as an addition to what
goes before, ,bought from a dealer
and at a high price. Macleane de-
fends it by asking, Why should he
. not call for a small cup? Because
the slave would hand it as a matter
of course.

149 Idem hautun eunctis] I have
no special favourite.

153 notos] You will frighten him,
you are a stranger.

154, 155] My slave is an ex-
ample of modesty to ‘ ingenui?

156 pupillares] Probably simply
under age, though the Scholiast is
relevant: “Quales habent hi qui
patires rton habetriit, scilicet tumentes
in icen ia pueri ae.

165

157 vellendas jam praebuit alas]
As a debauched master might say

pf ta slave that was growing up too
as .

159] The wine is not of the fa·

ι mous Greek kinds or of the choice

sorts of south Italy.

162 Gaditana] Dancing girls
seem to have been the principal and.
absorbing luxury of this great tra-
ding station, which was founded by
orientals before the Greek and Ro·
man forms of dissipation were in-
vented, nor were these, if they ever
penetrated as far as Gades, so well
suited to elderly business men, who
must have given the tone, . as the
dreamy contemplation of voluptuous
danceS.

165, 166] are so hopelessly
without a place, that they are
omitted in the same sort of MSS.
as omit 108. Others place them

8-2
