⁵ with his own hands; at another, recounting the deepest moral

degradation as coolly as an election 'commissionem who enjoys
the exposure of a corruption which he honestly intends to sup-

press, In the N inth Satire particularly the tone of bantering x

irony is almost as disgusting as the subject3 the Sixth is less
offensive, but the writer is obviously determined to extract the

, maximum of amusement from the painful subject of marriage,

which he regards from the old Roman point of view as a neces-
sary evil qr rather a disagreeable duty, which it is Quixotic to
undertake to perform for the public benefit, and childish to

could only become a little more reasonable for its own benefit,
not for theirS. Horace perhaps found -its folly ‘such good fun

except so far as it presented a temptation to himself: So sar as
they have a serious purpose (and Persius is very serious) they
preach where Juvenal denounceS. It was impossible for them
to stop short, like Juvenal, with a catalogue of vicious habits to '
be abandoned, of virtuous practices to be renewed3 their con-

> ception of virtue, without being precisely higher than his, was

at any rate more inward and more free. They did little per-
haps to raise the conception of character, but they succeeded
