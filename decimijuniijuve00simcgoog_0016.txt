the mention of his Agave proves that the Paris of the corn-

pleted satire must be Domitian's favourite. In spite of this,
however, most editors waver between Trajan and Hadrian,

inclining to the former, though it would be much more reason-
able to treat Trajan’s reign than Domitian's as a period of

literary decline. The Scholiast, who did not share their zeal

science, sayS, with naive absurdity, “ Neronem palpat.”

It is chiefly in the First 'and Eighth Satires that we find

plausible grounds for suspeeting allusions to the reign of

Nero, which have furnished such a plentiful harvest of con-
jectures to annotatorS, from the Scholiast downwardS. Madvig

probable; but notes like those on 1. 3 3—3 5, seem to embody
in a blundering way a real ancient tradition. The reader
shall judge :—“ Delator amici. Heliodorum significat delatorem
