if not before, and the burlesque epic solemnity of 37 sqq. would
be all the more amusing applied to a living contemporary. On
the other hand, the present form of the Satire may be later than
the death' of Crispinus. The last five lines which imply the
death of Domitian might be detached 3 but it is hardly possible
to mutilate the description of the proceres, and this as we have it
must be later than 95 mn„ the date of the execution of the
younger Acilius Glabrio, only a year at most before the death of
Domitian. It is difficult to fix the date at which Domitian
made himself conspicuous as the guardian of the morals of the
vestals ς we may assume that they were made aware of their
liabilities as soon as he did so: the first two victims of the
pontifex maximus were allowed to kill themselves above ground,
the third was put to death with the antiquarian formalities, A. n.
89 or 9 1.

The only indication of the date of the Fisth Satire is to be
found in vv. 107—110, which must belong to the generation
aster Ner03 but too much weight must not be given to them,
as 106—113 might be removed without injury, perhaps with
advantage, as an unnecessary aster-thought of the poet, who
was afraid that he had not brought out his real opinion of
Virro. - .

The date of the Seventh Satire must be determined by our
selection of the Caesar who is hailed at the beginning as the
solitary patron of the Muses. 1t is scarcely necessary to
exclude Hadrian, on the ground that Trajan had done nothing

to affiict the Nine3 for the contmst is not between the libe-
rality of one emperor and the illiberality of another, but

between imperial patronage and public indifference. On the
other hand, there is nothing in the satire that can be con·
strued into a reference to what had passed under Trajan, or
was passing under Hadrian, whereas the allusions to Domitian’s
reign are frequent. ἢ

We have references to the poverty of Saleius satirized by
Martial (ιν. 3. 6), to the recitations of StatiuS, which probably
began with the First Book of the Thebaid (which is said to¹
