78 D. JUNII JUVENALIS

More Numae caedit Jovis ante altaria, jurat
So-Lam Eponam et facies olida ad praesepia pictas.
Sed quum pervigiles placet instaurare popinas,
·Obvius assi-duo Syrophoenix udus amomo
Currit, Idumaeae Syrophoenix incola portae, 1 60
Hospitis affectu dominum regemque salutat,
Et cum venali Cyane succincta lagena„
Defensor culpae dicet mihi, “ Fecimus et nos

Esto. Desisti nempe, nec ultra

Fovisti errorem. Breve sit, quod turpiter audes3 1 65
Quaedam cum prima resecentur crimina barba3

Indulge veniam pueris: Lateranus ad illos

Thermarum calices inscriptaque lintea vadit,

Maturus bello, Armeniae Syriaeque tuendis

157 Mes] This is the only way
in which Juvenal can identify the
other objects of Lateranus’ worship3
he has not cared to remember their
names, but he knows their images
are painted up over the mangers.

158 popinas] They may have had
hot baths attached, as Mayor infers
from Thermae (inf. 168); but they
would not be called after the -great
Thermae, more likely Thermarum
-.= Thermopoliorum.

160 Idumaeae -- portae] Some

162 sumata] “ Ready both to
wait and dance.''

163, 164] “I may be told we
did the same too when we were

Ma or.

ιΞῚ lateranus] A noble, who
perished in the conspiracy of Piso,
bore this name: he had had arf
intrigue with Messalina.

168 Thermarum] It would be
luxui-ious, but not low, to drink at
the baths3 hence lintea is not likely
to mean ‘toweL’ Cf. sup. 158 n.—

Inscriptaque lintea .· ‘⁸ Hoc est pictis
velis popinae accedit aut linteis cap·
sariciis tergitur ” (Schol.). Accord-
ing to the first view, Lateranus, as
he was lounging aimlessly along,
saw the awning with its advertise·
ment of the accommodatiori within,
and he goes up to profit by it.

Orelli, Corpus Inscrtpt. N. 4329, .

gives one of these advertisements
from LyonS. Mercurius hic lucrum
promittit Apollo salutem: Septuma·
nus hospitium cum prandio. Qui
venerit melius utetur. Post, hos·
pes ubi maneas, prospice. This tavern
offered facilities for play, kept an
iatralipta. After arriving there the
traveller could spend the evening,
and sleep (for one night only) and
get his breakfast before looking out
for ermanent quartem. According
to t e second view, instead of eating
his dinner like a gentleman with a
clean napkin of his own, orhis host'S,
Lateranus uses napkins out of a
greasy capsa, marked with the eat-
ing-house mark to prevent them
from being stolen by discreditable
customers.

169 Armeniae syr-lneque] The
scene of Corbulo’s campaigns.
