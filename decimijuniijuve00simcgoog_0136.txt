·Quid‚ Catilina, tuis natalibus atque Cethegi-W*
Inveniet quisquam sublimius Ρ Arma tamen vos

Nocturna et flammas domibus templisque parastis,
Ut Braccatorum pueri Senonumque minoreS,

223 Quid] So all the MSS.
Madvig conjectures ’,φωτί which
gives a completer sense; quid may
have caught uvenal’ 5 ear, or the
copyist’ S. “ hat called more for
armed vengeanoe, what deed of
,Nero in that savage and' brutal
” tyranny?''

226 apium] He selects the Ne·
mean gameS, not as most charac-
teristic of Nero, but as having the
paltriest prize. Nero did not feel
that he was a 5ονοι eng-n 'playing the
buffoon to his subjects3 in theory he
was the fi'rst citizen who might claim
to prove himself first m grace- as in

ower, or else a god superior to
iiuman prejudices. No existing re-
lig-ion was more popul ar or more
sincere than Caesarism, and nobody
was better qualified than Caesar to
judge of its truth.

227 insignia vocis] The trophies
of a vocalist.

228 peden Domiti] The feet of a
Domitius, so marmoreo colosso (inf.
230). Nero’s own Colossus on the
vestibule of the golden house was
of brass and 120 feet high3 so a
lyre would have looked ridiculous
on it, even to Nero.

229 Amazones] On whom he
wrote a tragedy.—Personam, gene·

rally copied from his own featureS,
or those of his reigning mistress.

231 camina] L. Sergi us Catilina,
a fascinating and bountiful profli
gate, had profited by the licence os
Sulla's proscription‚ after which he
became the leader os the populares-5
and after being twice rejected as a
candidate sor the consulship, was
driven into formal rebellion by the

persevering exertions os Cicero (who
had left the populares and wanted
a bugbear to consolidate a party of
order out of the senate and knights),
while he (Catilina) was busy with
preparations (probably alternative)
sor a third canvass and sor a night
riot on a grand scale in which the
means once so effective against the
Gracchi might be employed to a·
venge them. When Catilina had left
Rome, his partisans compromised
their cause still surther by an intrigue
with the Allobroges, whose ambas-
sadors were at Rome, and easily
gained by Cicero. The whole nar-
rative illustrates the desperate con-
dition from which the popular party -
was raised by Clodius and Caesar.
Cethegus was a Cornelius.

234 Braocatorum] Opp. togato-
rum. It was the first Roman name
for the inhabitants os the Narbonese.
