xviii INTRODUCTION.

before breakfast the next morning. There are tempers to
which it is easier to put aside what has to be altered sor weeks‚
which grow into months. As tempers vary and our knowledge
of Juvenal’s is likely to remain imperfect, it is safest to re—
member the busy idleness in which a Roman gentleman passed
his life at the capital, and the lazy leisure of the country
holidayS, which is indicated by Horace’s EpistleS, and the
Eleventh Satire of Juvenal, and to conclude that the main
business of Juvenal's life was to live, and that his satires were
only occasional ebullitions os an indignation, not without in-
tervals and consolationS. “ Facit indignatio versum '³ is his
own motto ; and indignation is not a permanent motive for
exerti0n‚ since it is generally mixed with contempt3 for there
cannot be a better excuse sor indolence than scorn of the only
activity in which it is possible to take part. Our own Gifl'ord
was osten invoked to lash the vi'ces and follies of the age, but
sensibly concluded that it was not worth while to be always
in hot water for the sake of an age which needed so much
lashing.

'The writings osa satirist may easily leave us in doubt as to
the events of his life: it is not certain that-they will impress
us with the character of the writer, or even that they will be,
so far as they go, a trustworthy representation of his habitual
sels. We may reckon with more confidence upon finding
traces of his persona] ideas which are often distinctive‚ even
when the character is commonplace3 we may be sure of getting
a tolerably complete view of the points at which life bore
hardly upon the class and the generation which the satirist
represents,

It is hardly fanciful to trace in Juvenal the last protest of
the Marian democracy against the imperial system, as we trace
in Tacitus the protest of the expiring aristocracy of Sulla, rather
than of the effete oligarchy of Scaurus: like Sulla, Tacitus
desired that the Senate should be an open corporation rather
than a close one5 like Sulla, he believed.that the Senate ought
to be in a position to govem the Roman Empire 3 unlike Sulla,
