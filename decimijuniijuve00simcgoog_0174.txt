D. JUNII . JUVENALIS

Rectoris conferret opem: decidere jactu

Coepit cum ventiS, imitatus castora, qui se

Eunuchum ipse facit, cupiens evadere damno 35
Testiculi: adeo medicatum intelligit inguen.

‘⁴ Fundite, quae mea sunt,” dicebat, ‘⁴ cuncta,'’ CatulluS,
Praecipitare volens etiam pulcherrima, vestem

Purpuream, teneris quoque Maecenatibus aptam,

Atque aliaS, quarum generosi graminis ipsum 40
Infecit natura pecuS, sed et egregius sons

Viribus occultis et Baeticus adjuvat aer.

Ille nec argentum dubitabat mittere, lances

Parthenio factas, urnae cratera capacem, Ι

⁸ Et dignum sitiente Pholo vel conjuge Fusci3 45
Adde et - bascaudas et mille escaria, multum

Caelati, biberat quo callidus emtor Olynthi.

Sed quis nunc aliuS, qua mundi parte, quis audet

Argento praeferre caput rebusque salutem?

33 domuere] means a bargain,
especially a compromise with credi-
tors ς so Martial tells Domitian, that
if the gods wished to square ac-
counts with him, Heaven would be
bankrupt‚ and Jove ,would not be
able to offer a whole penny in the
shilling (ix. 4).

37 Pandite] Most of Catullus’
stores were too light to make the
ship labour, and accordingly we
hear that she was not eased by
parting with them; he seems to
have had a crazy sear of drowning,
which was no better than a stupe·
⁸ fying sear of poverty.

40 quarum—pecus] ‘⁶ The flocks
whereof‚ the flocks that supply
these.” On the Guadalquivir the
sheep have a sort of golden wool, or
a deep brown. The passage looks
an unsuccesssul attempt at a sneer,
as if Juvenal would have said ‘ ‘Which
realises the apocalyptic promises of
the Pollio, about sheep running
about with their fleeces ready dyed,

only the air and the water have
something to do with it too.’'

44 Parthenio natas] “Which
Parthenius could claim as his w'ork ;’'
this is the force of the dative (cs. i.
542 n·)·

—· mae} About 3 gallonsz os
course the crater held more, though
it is not clear how much. Juvenal
means to say either that it would
hold 3 gallons of wine, and water in
proportion, or more probably, as
water was drawn in an urna, that it
would hold 3 gallons of water, aud
{vine-in plrioporuon, about 4 or 5 gal-
ons m a .

45 coniuge Fusci] Of course a.
well-known character. Juvenal, un·
like Martial, never proclaims his
respect for the sanctity of private
lise; and it may be doubted whether
even Martial avoided butts too no·
torious to be hurt by a joke.

47 callidus emtor olynthi] Phili
quoted as a rich drinker who con&
employ old Greek artist8.'
