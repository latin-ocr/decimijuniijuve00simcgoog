74 D. JUNII 'JUVENALIS

Quum Paga eripiat, quidquid tibi Qua reliquit,
Jamque tace: furor est post omnia perdere nat-glum.
N jon idem gemitus olim, neque vulnus erat pas
Damnorum, sociis florentibus et modo victis·

’ Plena domus tunc omniS, et ingens stabat acervus

· 95, 96 Pansa] A Marian family,-
raised by Caesar. —Natta, an old
cognomen of an obscure family os
the gens Pinaria. Juvenal would
know it from the snob in Horace.
Probably, “When the noble go-
vemor robs you of what the plebeian
lest, relieve yourself by putting
up your rags to aucfion, to get the
money sor a voyage to Rome. When
you’ve got it, don't be such a fool
as go. '’ Igive the MS. order: some
ed. transpose 95, 96. The Scholiast
thinks the object of the sale is
simply to live on the proceeds·

101 spartana] Forthed y.e —Coa
for the material. The discovery of
unravelling silk stuffs and weaving
them up more loosely, was made m
CeoS, according to Pliny, who adds,
that there are silk· -worms in Cos
(H. N. xi. 20).

105 Dolabellae] A conjecture
founded on the fact that P. has
‘ Dolabella est,’ and most MSS.
omit est. 1f so, the sense will be,
“The Dolabellas on this side, and
Antonius on that.’' The Dolabellas
are CneiuS, consul 13.C. 81, prose
cuted by Caesar Β. c. 77 for extor-
tion in Macedonia, and acquitted‚
Cneius‚ praetor 81, prosecuted Β. c.
78 for extortion in Cilicia and con·
demned. Publius, Cicero’ s son- in*

law, consul Β. e. 44, shewed great
rapacity on his route to Syria. An·

tom'us, the brother of the orator and
uncle of the triumvir, consul Β. c.

63 z condemned after his return from
the government of Macedonia.

106 verres] A retainer of Sulla,
who govemed Sicily during the re-
volt of Spartacus· it was convenient
to the government that he should
raise as large a revenue from the
province as possible: he did raise
a large revenue ; but his adminis-
tration was so cynically reckless
that his was selected as the test case
to support the measure of trans-

winds up a story of L. Piso Frugi
with the remark, — “Nimirum ut
hic [Verres] nomen suum compro·
bavit, sic ille [Piso] cognomen,
which proves that Verres had no
gentile name; for if he had, Verres
would not have ceased to be his
