2 D. JUNH JUVENALIS

Scriptus et in terg0, nec dum finituS, Orestes ?

has not done yet: et, even when
out os its usual place, generally
goes with the word which comes
α er it.

st7 lucus m] “In quo Ilia
peperit‚” Schol., would occur in a
poem on Romulus: the rest, as far
as Aeacus, suggests a ‘rifacimento’
of the Odyssey. Alius must· be
taken as indicating a transition to
another legendary cycle, otherwise
we might place the grov'e in Colchos,
according to another guess of‘ the
Scholiast, and refer the rocks of
Aeolus, in the modern Stromboli‚
and cave of Vulcan, in the modern
“. Vulcano, to the Argonautic legend,

⁵ on the authority os Ap. Rhodius

(iv. 761).

11 quantas] The poetasters re·-
Ὺ fine upon Ovid: “insani dejectam
viribus Austri Forte trabem nactus.’'
Monychus = MononychuS, a cen-

* taur.

12 Frontonis] Pliny (Ep. ii. 11,
ἓ 3) praises the oratory os one
Fronto Catius, ‘who may have be·
queathed to P. Cornelius Fronto,
the tutor of M. Aurelius, the horti
Maecenatiani‚ on the strength of
which he claimed connexion with
Horace.

walls, shaken by the shouts of the
audience, which is hardly consistent

with platani ,- Macleane, os the mar·
ble pillars, which makes columnae
tautological. One is tempted to
think of marble statues, cf. xiii. 115:
as if the poet's friends told him
his stirring verse was enough to
make stones cry out, while Juvenal
implies that they echoed the noise
he made, which was enough to shake
them on their pedestals.

13 assiduo ruptae lectore] Mayor
follows Hand in thinking that the
omission of ab marks the absence
of' voluntary agency. Hand admits
that the omission only occurs in the

an ablative absolute, because there
is a reader always leaning against
them, because readers give them no
rest3 cf. viii. 137, hebetes lasso lic-
tore secures.

15 ergo] This is to be taken in
connection with the preceding line.
All poets troet the same subjects ;
well, I am qualified to treat them
too, inf. 19 tamen serves to conti-ast
hoc with eadem.

must have been decided on long
ago. Cf. vii. 1613 x. 167. Boys
