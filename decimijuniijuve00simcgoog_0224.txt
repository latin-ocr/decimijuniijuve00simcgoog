170. D. JUNII JUVENALIS
Legibus antiquis castrorum et more Camilli ι 5

Servato, miles ne vallum litiget extra

Et procul a signis. justissima Centurionum

Cognitio est igitur de milite3 nec mihi deerit

Ultio, si justae defertur causa querelae.

Tota cohors tamen est inimica, omnesque manipli 20
Consensu magno efficiunt, curabilis ut sit ⁴

Vindicta et gravior, quam injuria. Dignum erit ergo
Declamatoris mulino corde VageIIi,

Quum duo crura habeaS, offendere tot caligas, tot

Millia. clavorum. Quis tam procul absit ab urbe? 2 5
Praeterea quis tam Pylades, molem aggeris ultra

Ut veniat? Lacrimae siccentur protinuS, et se

Excusaturos non sollicitemus amicOS,

Da testem, judex quum dixerit, audeat ille,

Nescio quiS, pugnos qui vidit, dicere, Vidi? 3ο
Et credam dignum barba, dignumque capillis

17 santissimo, sq.] The words of
the imaginary litigant, ‘⁸ We11, the
centurion has a right to judge the
soldier, and he is sure to judge him
justly,” διο.

21 curabffls] Such as need a
remedy. perhaps more generally
‘ anxiouS,' ‘ an anxious business.’

24 caligas] The boots os the
rank and file, who are certain to
take the part of their comrade even
if the centurions do not ς the latter
wear the calceus. though it is pre-
sunsably of the kind known as Bar·
daicus, which was adopted from the
Bardaei, a people of Illyria.

2 5 qun—urbo] Juvenal antici-
pates the excuse that the civilian’s
friends are sure to make3 though
the excuse is transparent‚ it is not
unmeaning: the praetorian camp

was a considerable distance from the
former, and most of the pleasantest
and busiest parts of Rome,

26] Here Juvenal suggests their
real motive for putting forward the
above excuse. ι

300. The date was attested by
public documents at Ardea (Varro,
R. R. ii. 11, 5 ιο).

33 mum] “A civilian.’' An-
tonius Primus (Tac. Hist. iii. 24),
taunts his soldiers by this word, as
Caesar subdued a mutiny by calling
his soldiers Quirites. The distinction
is worth noticing. ΤΙιε Quirites,
points to the legal status of unarmed
citizens, paganus it ωτι soercely be
doubted is originally a piece of mili-

tary slang.
