In reading Tacitus we are never allowed for an instant to '

escape from the impression that the tyranny of the imperial
government was the crying evil of the age and the parent of all
the rest 3 in the letters of Pliny (though he represents perhaps a
later period than Juvenal) we see something of the bright side
of that part of Roman society to which imperial tyranny was
'the one flaw in an universe otherwise admirable. But Juve-

austere Tacitus and the complaisant Martial insupport of their
homage to their favourite3 but he made no impression whatever
on the sturdy 'puritanism of Juvenal. The third and fifth satires
