D. JUN11 JJJVENALIS

Annulus in digito quod ferreus. Ergo superbum

Convivam caven, qui me sibi comparat, et res

130

Despicit exiguas. Adeo nulla uncia nobis

Est eboriS, nec tessellae, nec calculus ex hac

. Materia: quin ipsa manubria cultellorum

Ossea: non tamen his ulla unquam opsonia fiunt

Rancidula, aut ideo pejor gallina secatur.

135

Sed' nec structor erit, cui cedere debeat omnis
Pergula‚ discipulus Trypheri doctoriS‚ apud quem
Sumine cum 'magno lepuS, atque aper, et pygarguS,
Et Scythicae volucreS, et phoenicopterus ingenS,

Et Gaetulus oryx hebeti lautissima ferro

140

Caeditur et· tota sonat ulmea coena Suburra.
Nec frustum capreae subducere, nec latus Afrae

Novit avis noster tirunculuS, ac rudis omni
Tempore, et exiguae furtis imbutus ofellae.

Plebeios calices et paucis assibusv emtos

ι 145

Porriget incultus puer atque a frigore tutus;

131 Adeo] “ So absolutely des-
titute am 1 of so much as an ounce

of ivory.’'

135, 136] “The bone handles
carve as well as ivory, and the
meat tastes just as nice ; but you
won' t get a professional carver
either”, (any more than an orna·
mental knife).

137 Tryphon] τρυφέρου, delicate.

1 39 Scythicae volucres] Generally
taken for pheasants, which Pertinax
never served at private feasts3 and
Alex. Severus only “Iovis epulo
et Saturnalibus et hujusmodi festis
diebus.” ,

- phoenicopterus ingens] “The
tongue and brain of the flamingo
were most esteemed.'' Mayor.

140] The wooden dinner re·
presents the greatest dainties; but
they are taught to carve it with
blunt kniveS, as good workmen
should never find fault with their

tools.--Lautissima cannot refer to
their present attainment‚ as they are
so noisy. In another writer one
would hardly venture to suspect, at
the expense of the connection, that

hebeti lautissima ferro refers exclu· . a

sively to Gaetulus oryx, and translate
“ And the Gaetulian oryx is cut up
with a blunt knife, which is the best
way to keep the flavour of the
meat. ’⁰ ’

142, sq.] “Not having been
taught to carve dainty dishesr he
does not know how to steal from
them.'' The Roman servants seem
to have stolen at table—Avis Afrae,
probably guinea fowl.

144 ofellae] ‘⁶ Et quae non egeant
ferro structoris ofellae'’ (Mart. x.
xlviii. 15). Diminutive of ‘offa,’ the
first shortened, as ‘mamilla‚' from

‘ mamma?
146 a msere tutus] ‘⁸ Not half-

naked.'' He needs to be decently
