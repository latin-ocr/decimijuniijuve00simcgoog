viii INTRODUCTION.

ing the imputation of conferi-ing military commands at the
suggestion of an actor, especially when the actor’s influence
had been retnoved; nor would his resentment be lessened if
Juvenal had deliberately republished, with an application to
his own reign, what had been originally directed against the
earlier PariS, the favourite of N er0. A wider question suggests
‚itself here. Did Juvenal begin to write under Nero, and to
publish under Do‘mitian, while the revised edition of his works
was interrupted by death, perhaps in Trajan's reign ?

That some such revised edition was attempted is probable‚
from the statement of· one old biographer, that a considerable
interval elapsed between the original composition of the lines
on Paris, and their reappearance in the Seventh Satire3 from
the remark of another, that he enlarged (ampliavit) his satires
in exile3 and from the curious circumstance that there are
MSS. in which the Sixteenth Satire, a mere fragment is placed
· before t-he Fifteenth. Obviously, copyists must have changed
the order which Juvenal intended, in order that all the satires
might appear to be finished, except the last, · perhaps also
those who doubted the genuineness of the fragment may have
wished to propagate their suspicions by relegating it to a sort
of Appendix.1f Juvenal was in the habit of retouching his
compositions, it is obviously unsafe to infer the date of a satire
from single lines3 for in such a laboured style innumerable
additions and insertions would be possible, which would 'im-
prove the brilliancy of the general effect, without impairing its
unity. Hence we cannot build much upon the following list
of passages.

In 1. 47, vm. 120, Juvenal mentions the exile and rapacity
of Marius Priscus, who was condemned for oppression in pro-
consular Africa, ΑΛ). 100, which is the latest date that we can
fix with certainty.

In vr. 502, there is an allusion to the successive layers of
curls, which cannot be traced on the imperial busts, our only
authority, higher than the reign of Trajanj, but (ib. 385) a
musician is mentioned, who was* already famous when Mat-7
